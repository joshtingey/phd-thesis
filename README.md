This repository contains everything for my UCL PhD thesis "Convolution neural networks for
the CHIPS neutrino detector R&D project". 

A pdf of the complete document is automatically built and can be found
[here](https://joshtingey.github.io/phd-thesis/thesis.pdf). Or this repo can be downloaded and the
pdf built using...

```bash
make
```

You will need a full texlive installation (see .devcontainer folder for complete environment
details). Furthermore, the python packages required for the plotting notebook are included in
requirements.txt
