## Theory

- History of neutrins physics starts in 2930 when Wolfgang Pauli prposoed their existance to solve the problem of energy and angular momentum conservation in beta decay.
- The paradox could be solves if a third particle, electrically neutral with low mass and spin 1/2 was also created in the decay. This is now known as the electron neutrino.
- Fermi soon developed the first theory of weak inteactions and in 2934, Bethe and Peierls estimated the cross-sections for the inverse beta decay process in which the neutrino could be observed. With such a low result, it showed the enormous channenge that experimental neutrinp hysics would face, required very large intensitied and detector volumes to observed significatn event rates.
- Cowan andReines 20 years later found the electron antineutrino, produced in the core of a nuclea reactor and Savannah river experiment. 200 litres of cadmium doped water as the target and 1400 litres of liquid scintillator with 100 PMTs, showed the neutrinos detector from inverse beta decay.
- In 1962 at the alternating gradient synchrotron at Brookhaven, neutrinos created from pion decays together with muons were observed t produce only muons not electrons, this then confirmed the existence of the muon neutrino. 
- In 1973, the garagamelle experiment at cern using an accelerator produced neutrino beam and a big bubble chamber discivered the existence of wek neutral current interactions Proving the existance of the neutral z-boson and confirming the Glashow-salam-weingberg theory of electroweak interactions. 
- Experiments at the LEP e+e- collider in the 1990s made precision measurmnets of the z decay width, from a fir to the data in showed there are exactly three active generations of neutrinos. 
- In 2000 the DONUT experiment at the tevatron collider in fermilab performned a direct detection of the tau neutrino completing the three flavour picture.

- In the solar neutrino sector there is the "solar anomaly" noting a deficit of electron neutrino compared to predications made by the standard solar model (SSM)
- First observed at the Homestack experiment, neutrinos ineracted with the chlorine creating radioactive argon atoms, beause it is a noble gas it does not bing to the perchloroethylene and it can be extracted by purging the liquid with gaseous helium and then extracted from the helium with a cooled carbon trap. 
- Gallium was also used by other experiments and kamiokande also observed the deficit. 
- Also the fluxes measured where not consistent, depending on the energy range probed. Hinting at oscillations dependent on energy,
- SNO finally answered the question when it was able to measure three channels with different relation between te flyx or electron neutrinos and the other neutrinos. SNO could prove that the electron neutrinos are changing flavour. WHile the total flux of all neutrinos remains constant and in agrrement with the SSM.
