## [Three-flavour neutrino oscillations with MINOS and CHIPS](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1551615/1/Perch_ID_thesis.pdf)

### Theory

- Proposal of a mysterious undetector particle to explain beta decays in the 1930s through to the resolutions of a 30-year problem with the confirmation of oscillations in the early 2000s and onto the precision era.
- Neutrino oscillations first discoveed in 1957 when Bruno Pornecorvo proposed a model in which neutrinos oscilate to antineutrinos and back, similar to the kain. It was actually shown that neutrinos iscilate from one flavour to another. 
- Wolfgang Pauli first pusoluated the neutrino in 1931 to account for the non-conservation of energy/angular momentum in beta decays. A simple two-body decay at rest should produce an electron carrying away a fixed kinetci energy corresponding to the difference in binding energies of the nuclei, but a continuos spectrum was observed. Therefore, he postulated the extistnse of a unseen second particle, alwso emmited in the decay which was undetected. This must be a neutral spin-1/2 fermion, and he named it the 'neutron'
- Was named neutrino after the neutron was discovered.
- The antineutrino was discovered by Reines and Cowan in 1956, using inverse beta decay in a 200l tank of water, detecting neutrinos from the Los Alamos nuclear reactor.
- Muon neutrino discovered by the 'long track' from the decays of pions from a reactor in 1988, got a nobel prize.
- DONUT finally found the tau neutrino in 2000 using 800GeV protons from the Tevatron.
- Hence, all flavours of neutrino had been found, but the strongest constraint is due to the width of the Z^0 resonance. THis indicates the number of active neutrino states can only be 1.984+-0.008. Therefore, any as yet undiscovered neutrinos must be sterile, in that they do not couple to the weak interaction. 
- Cosmology can also constrain the number of active neutrino with a value about 3.3+-0.27, the planck satellite did this.

- As the standard model of particle physics was developed, neutrinos were presumed to be massless and occur only in the three flavour eigenstates.
- Various hints that this was not the case kept appearing, leading to neutrino oscillations, by witch one neutrino can oscillate to another flavour and the non-zero masses that follow as a direct consiquence from this.
- The solar neutrino problem:
  - The sun produces a rich source of electron neutrinos
  - Various processes cobine to form the PP-chain, which overall fuse four protons to produce a helium necleus. 
  - 4p+ 2e−→4He + 2νe+ 26.73MeV−Eν
  - whereEνis the energy of the two neutrinos, and (26.73 MeV -Eν) is the energyemitted as photons
  - In the 1960's at the Homestake mine, a 100000 gallon tank of perchloroethylene, dry-cleaning fluid, detected neutrinos from the boron-8 decay via the CC neutrino capture reaction νe+37Cl→37Ar +e−(threshold 814 keV) with the tank periodically flushed with helium to remove and measure the amount of argon produced and hence the number of neutrinos detected.
  - A discrepancy was seen between the SNU (solar neutrino unit), number of interactions per cl37 per second and that predicted by theory. 
  - Inital measurements was of 3.0 SNU compared with predctions ranging from 4.4 o 21 SNU
  - Final homestake measurement in the 1990s showd 2.56+_0.16(stat)+_0.16(syst) compared with 6.4-9.3 depending on model paramters from theory.
  - The kamiokande-11 water cherenkov detector also observed this deficit. Which was also capable to inferring the neutrinos directions and showing that they originated from the sun. Measuring a value of 0.46 that of the SSM prediction. 
  - Both SAGE and GALLEX also reported the deficit.
  - Neutrino oscillations were one wasy of explaining this deficit. In the electron neutrinos were convertd to muon or tau neutrinos, the electrons in the detector medium would not be able to capture them, additionally solar neutrinos has insufficienct energy to produce muons or taus which would allow their detection in a water cherenkov detector. 
  - The SNO experiment finally demonstrated that this was the case in 2001-2002. 
  - A 1kton tank of heavy water, containing h^2 isotopes, was able to detect solar neutrinos via three different channels νe+d→p+p+e−, νx+d→p+n+νx and νx+e−→νx+e− where d in the heavy deuterium nucelus. The first channel is a CC interaction only sensitive to electron neutrinos. The second is an NC interactions and is sensitive to neutrinos of any flavour, detected via the gamma rays produced when the dislodged neutron thermalises and is captured by another nucelous. The final channel is elastic scattering of the neutrino from an electron and is again sensitive to all three neutrino flavours.
  - By comparing the fluxes measured with the three channels and deividing them into the component attributed to electron neutrinos. SNO demonstrated a 5.3 sigma singal of oscillations from electrons neutrinos to the other flavours.
