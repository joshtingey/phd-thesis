### Historical background (~1500 words)

Proposal of a mysterious undetector particle to explain beta decays in the 1930s through to the resolutions of a 30-year problem with the confirmation of oscillations in the early 2000s and onto the precision era.
Neutrino oscillations first discoveed in 1957 when Bruno Pornecorvo proposed a model in which neutrinos oscilate to antineutrinos and back, similar to the kain. It was actually shown that neutrinos iscilate from one flavour to another.
Wolfgang Pauli first pusoluated the neutrino in 1931 to account for the non-conservation of energy/angular momentum in beta decays. A simple two-body decay at rest should produce an electron carrying away a fixed kinetci energy corresponding to the difference in binding energies of the nuclei, but a continuos spectrum was observed. Therefore, he postulated the extistnse of a unseen second particle, alwso emmited in the decay which was undetected. This must be a neutral spin-1/2 fermion, and he named it the 'neutron'
Was named neutrino after the neutron was discovered.
The antineutrino was discovered by Reines and Cowan in 1956, using inverse beta decay in a 200l tank of water, detecting neutrinos from the Los Alamos nuclear reactor.
Muon neutrino discovered by the 'long track' from the decays of pions from a reactor in 1988, got a nobel prize.
DONUT finally found the tau neutrino in 2000 using 800GeV protons from the Tevatron.
Hence, all flavours of neutrino had been found, but the strongest constraint is due to the width of the Z^0 resonance. THis indicates the number of active neutrino states can only be 1.984+-0.008. Therefore, any as yet undiscovered neutrinos must be sterile, in that they do not couple to the weak interaction.
Cosmology can also constrain the number of active neutrino with a value about 3.3+-0.27, the planck satellite did this.
