# todo

+ [ ] Add plots and diagrams with checkboxes to chapter plans
+ [ ] Finish current plot python implementation
+ [ ] Make a detailed plan of the theory chapter
+ [ ] Do lecture 3 of ml-course
+ [ ] Read 2019 PDG Review for neutrinos
+ [x] Finish singularity implementation to get it out the way

# Backlog

+ [ ] Study which NC events are causing the main problems
+ [ ] Run old reconstruction on a sample of chips_1200 events and summarise performance
+ [ ] Finish implementation of 'tf_explain' type plots for the CVN
+ [ ] Implement a model that predicts primary particles
+ [ ] Make CVN output plots stacked
+ [ ] Implement CVN output plots in thesis from .root output file
+ [ ] Finish implementing all plots so far in python
+ [ ] Cosmic flux/events plots for thesis
+ [ ] Table of expected (visable due to threshold) events for thesis
+ [ ] Run multiple height geometries through the simulation
+ [ ] Run different attenuation length through the simulation
+ [ ] Create simulation 'quality check' plots 
+ [ ] Update CVN 'example' usage
+ [ ] Add other tree to CVN output .root file to store metadata
+ [ ] Use large images in the mapper
+ [ ] Figure out a way to cut certain PMTs in the mapper
+ [ ] Maybe introduce smearing in the mapper
+ [ ] Add plots to tensorboard for quick analysis
+ [ ] Combine CVN dependencies with rest of CHIPS software and integrate ROOT classes
+ [ ] Finish multi-task implementation with learned loss weighting
+ [ ] Finish implementing all 'sub-classesd' layers and blocks with references (put in bits-and-bobs)
+ [ ] Weight categories in Keras training by fraction of the total
+ [ ] Finish and debug chips-env singularity implementation
+ [ ] Generate energy and efficiency Globes matrices as simple output from the CVN
