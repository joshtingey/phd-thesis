## [Simulations and Data analysis for the35 ton Liquid Argon detector as aprototype for the DUNE experiment](https://s3.cern.ch/inspire-prod-files-1/1f9a4b01abccb6069221bf6e75cef20a)

### Theory

- Neutrino was first proposed to explain the continuous energy spectrum of the electrons observed in beta-decay. 
- Fermi proposed a more complete model of beta decay in 1934, also proposing that the mass could be measured by looking at the end point of the beta decay spectrum. The first experiment set an upper limit of 500ev which was imporved to 250 ev, with the idea that hthe neutrino was massless gaining traction.
- The first directr obervation of neutrino was in 1956, and in 1962 proof that the electron and muon neutrinos are distinct particle. Found by observing that is was far more likely that the neutrinos produced in the decay of pions would interact to create muons and opposed to electrons. Meaning there had to be two flavour of neutrinos as if there was a single flavour it should produce equal number sof electron and muons.
- The homstake experiment observed the solar neutrino problem
