TASK BACKLOG

TODO: GLoBES energy estimation output
TODO: GLoBES selection efficiency output
TODO: Which cosmic events are the ones causing the biggest problems?
TODO: Which NC events are the ones causing the biggest problems?
TODO: Fractional scaling resiliance studies
TODO: Absolute scaling resiliance studies
TODO: Noise resiliance studies
TODO: Removal of pixels/non-uniform distruption resiliance studies
TODO: Seperate out different CC types selection efficiencies to talk about differences
TODO: Makes notes on Stefano meeting
TODO: Change fraction of energy vs e plot to scattering q values not percentages
TODO: Express improvements in FOM value as less time required to reach the same physics significance.
TODO: For detector optimisations want to optimise for FOM/surface_area_of_pmts (best use of moneyz)
TODO: Add optimised cut values to the output distribution plots
TODO: Redo energy comparison just for ccqel events as that is a better metric rather than DIS in old reco which is awful
TODO: Check that t_escapes works with cosmics in the mapper
TODO: Get all sections/subsectons in each chapter planned out and get everything into its correct section.
