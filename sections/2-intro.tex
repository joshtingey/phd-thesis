It is abundantly evident that machine learning and the broader field of artificial intelligence
will play an ever-increasing role in the world around us over the coming years. Virtually every
industry and human on the planet are promised to be touched by their proliferation. Whether this
change has a entirely positive or somewhat detrimental effect on society as a whole is still
questionable, however, within the field of physics, especially experimental particle physics,
machine learning applications can only be seen in a positive light.

Already, a widespread revolution is underway across the field. From the way particle interactions
are simulated to the way recorded events are analysed, machine learning techniques, usually deep
learning algorithms, are yielding dramatic performance improvements. This is particularly true of
the study of the vastly abundant yet incredibly difficult to detect neutrino. Principally driven
by the fact that the raw output from neutrino detectors is well suited to the algorithms at the
forefront of computer vision research, many neutrino experiments now routinely use deep learning
methods for event analysis.

However, to date, a thorough end-to-end implementation of such techniques is not yet in use for
the reconstruction and classification of neutrino events within long-baseline water Cherenkov
detectors studying accelerator beam neutrinos. Without redress, this lack of progress could have
significant implications for the future of neutrino physics, especially when such experiments are
deemed a highly promising (and potentially cheap) channel for answering some of the critical
unsolved problems of the field.

This thesis presents a broad range of work conducted for one such experiment, the CHerenkov
detectors In mine PitS (\chips) neutrino detector R\&D project. \chips aims to develop very large
yet `cheap as chips' water Cherenkov detectors that can be deployed into deep bodies of water of
the Earth's surface, allowing megaton scale detectors to become a reality. The author's principal
contribution comes from the novel application of Convolutional Neural Networks, a type of deep
learning algorithm, to the reconstruction, classification, and energy estimation of neutrino
events within the \chipsfive prototype detector module.

It is hoped that the work presented in this thesis will achieve three principal goals. Firstly,
motivate the need for the \chips project and detail how it accomplishes its aims. Secondly, show
that Convolutional Neural Networks can be used to fully reconstruct and classify neutrino events
within water Cherenkov detectors in an explainable and robust manner whilst also providing
significant performance improvements. Finally, inform the development of similar Convolutional
Neural Network applications for other water Cherenkov neutrino detectors.

To begin, \ChapterRef{chap:theory} introduces the history of neutrino physics, as well as the
theoretical background and current status of the field as motivation for the \chips project. A
full description of the \chips detector concept follows in \ChapterRef{chap:chips}, with a
principal focus on the \chipsfive prototype detector module deployed into the \numi neutrino beam
during the autumn of 2019. A particularly detailed overview of the \chipsfive data acquisition and
monitoring systems is then given in \ChapterRef{chap:daq}, for which the author played a major
role.

\ChapterRef{chap:cnn} begins by introducing the standard reconstruction and classification methods
to be replaced alongside a review of the relevant neural network theory and current deep learning
applications within the field of neutrino physics. The chapter concludes by detailing the three
Convolutional Neural Networks developed for \chipsfive, including that for cosmic muon rejection,
beam event classification, and neutrino energy estimation.

The thesis closes in \ChapterRef{chap:results} with a comprehensive evaluation of the new
Convolutional Neural Network approach. Firstly, the final combined performance is determined and
compared with similar experiments. Secondly, the inner workings of the trained networks are
explored. Thirdly, the robustness of the network outputs to distributional changes in the input is
studied. Finally, alternative implementations are discussed to highlight the key factors driving
performance.
