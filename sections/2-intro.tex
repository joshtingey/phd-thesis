It is abundantly evident that machine learning and the broader field of artificial intelligence
will play an ever-increasing role in the world around us over the coming years. Virtually every
industry and human on the planet is promised to be touched by their proliferation. Whether this
change has a positive or detrimental effect on society as a whole is still questionable, however,
within the field of physics, especially experimental particle physics, machine learning
applications can only be seen in a positive light.

Already, a widespread revolution is underway across the field. From the way particle interactions
are simulated to the way recorded events are analysed, machine learning techniques, usually deep
learning algorithms, are yielding dramatic improvements. This is particularly true of the study of
the vastly abundant yet incredibly difficult to detect neutrino. Principally driven by the fact
that the raw output from neutrino detectors is well suited to the algorithms at the forefront of
computer vision research, many neutrino experiments now routinely use deep learning methods for
event analysis.

However, to date, a thorough end-to-end implementation of such techniques is not in use for the
reconstruction, classification, and energy estimation of neutrino events within long-baseline
water Cherenkov detectors using accelerator beam neutrinos. Without redress, this lack of progress
could have significant implications for the future of neutrino physics, especially when such
experiments are deemed a highly promising (and potentially cheap) channel for answering some of
the critical unsolved problems of the field.

This thesis presents a broad range of work conducted for the CHerenkov detectors In mine PitS
(\chips) neutrino detector R\&D project. \chips aims to deploy very large yet `cheap as chips'
water Cherenkov detectors into deep bodies of water on the Earth's surface. The author's principal
contribution comes from the novel application of Convolutional Neural Networks to the
reconstruction, classification, and energy estimation of neutrino events within one of these the
detectors, the \chipsfive prototype module.

To begin, Chapter.~\ref{chap:theory} introduces the history of neutrino physics, as well as the
theoretical background and current status of the field as motivation for the broader \chips
project. A full description of the \chips detector concept follows in Chapter.~\ref{chap:chips},
with a principle focus on the \chipsfive prototype detector module deployed into the \numi
neutrino beam during the autumn of 2019. A particularly detailed overview of the \chipsfive data
acquisition and monitoring systems is then given in Chapter.~\ref{chap:daq}, for which the author
played a primary role.

Chapter.~\ref{chap:cnn} begins by introducing the standard reconstruction and classification
methods to be replaced alongside a review of the relevant neural network theory and current
machine learning applications within the field of neutrino physics. The chapter concludes by
detailing the three Convolutional Neural Networks developed for \chipsfive, including that for
cosmic muon rejection, beam event classification, and neutrino energy estimation.

The thesis closes in Chapter.~\ref{chap:results} with a comprehensive evaluation of the new
Convolutional Neural Network approach. Firstly, the final combined performance is determined and
compared with similar experiments. Secondly, the inner workings of the trained networks are
explored. Thirdly, the robustness of the network outputs to distributional changes in the input is
studied. Finally, alternative implementations are discussed to highlight the key factors driving
performance.

It is hoped that the work presented in this thesis will achieve two principle goals. Firstly,
motivate the need for a detector concept such as \chips for the long term success of the field of
neutrino physics. Secondly, inform the development of similar Convolutional Neural Network
applications for other water Cherenkov neutrino detectors. The real power of such techniques is
still not fully understood, and only time will tell what additional impact they may have within
neutrino physics.
