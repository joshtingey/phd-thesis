TASK BACKLOG

TODO: GLoBES energy estimation output
TODO: GLoBES selection efficiency output
TODO: Which cosmic events are the ones causing the biggest problems?
TODO: Which NC events are the ones causing the biggest problems?
TODO: Fractional scaling resiliance studies
TODO: Absolute scaling resiliance studies
TODO: Noise resiliance studies
TODO: Romoval of pixels/non-uniform distruption resiliance studies
TODO: Seperate out different CC types selection efficiencies to talk about differences
TODO: Implement a simple containment cut the make the energy stuff better (do I need to train with this)?
TODO: Putiry/Eff per muon to remove flux dip in efficiency, hopefully shape is flat
TODO: Fix 18 vs 16 categories bug
TODO: Makes notes on Stefano meeting
TODO: Change fraction of energy vs e plot to scattering q values not percentages
TODO: Express improvements in FOM value as less time required to reach the same physics significance.
TODO: For detector optimisations want to optimise for FOM/surface_area_of_pmts (best use of moneyz)
TODO: Add optimised cut values to the output distribution plots
TODO: Add /250Mev or whatever the binning is to events histogram
TODO: Add hadronic energy as a variable to the events
TODO: Fix missing lepton energy values
