- It is now abundantly clear that convolutional neural networks will play a key role in the event
reconstruction and classification for \chips. What is also clear is that other water Cherenkov
neutrino experiments, which up to now have not fully embraced modern machine learning techniques
as much as other sectors of the neutrino field should do so. For a range of benefits from
increased processing time, leverage the wider computer vision ML field to make the advancements
for you while you focus on the physics analysis.
