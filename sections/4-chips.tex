\chapter{The \chips R\&D Project} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{chap:chips}

In pursuit of answers to the open questions outlined in the previous chapter, neutrino experiments
are becoming increasingly, and possibly prohibitively, expensive and impractical. This is
particularly true of the next generation of long baseline experiments, DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande,
with cost estimates reaching billions of dollars and construction times of greater than half a
decade. It is also telling that just these two future projects receive  the vast majority of
global research effort, such is their complexity, cost, and lead time.

It is clear that for detectors to remain practical and affordable into the future, a novel
approach to neutrino detector design is highly desirable. This is especially the case if megaton
scale detectors are ever to become a reality. While instrumentation will continue to improve with
time, the statistics of low event counts will always limit neutrino experiments until vastly
larger detectors can be built. Therefore, R\&D efforts must focus on such detectors now, whilst
also attempting to complement the current and upcoming generation of experiments.

The \chips R\&D project~\cite{adamson2013} aims to develop novel strategies and technologies for
very large yet `cheap as chips' water Cherenkov detectors. Primarily aimed for deployment in long
baseline accelerator beam scenarios, \chips aims to lower the construction cost per kt of fiducial
mass to between \$200k-\$300k. For comparison, the Super-Kamiokande detector reached a cost of
approximately \$4 million/kt to build. As physics sensitivity depends on more than just fiducial
volume, this comparison is not entirely rigorous; however, it highlights the scale of cost savings
possible.

This chapter aims to describe the fundamental aspects of the \chips R\&D project in detail.
Firstly, the \chips concept will be outlined along with neutrino beam and Cherenkov detector
physics for context. The design, construction, deployment, and status of the \chipsfive prototype
detector will then follow. Finally, the Monte Carlo event generation and detector simulation
framework will be introduced to aid the discussion of work presented in later chapters of this
thesis.

\section{\chips concept} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:chips_concept} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The \chips concept is to construct cylindrical water Cherenkov detectors that can be sunk to the
bottom of deep bodies of water on the Earth's surface, such as lakes, reservoirs and flooded mine
pits. The water above the sunken detector provides a modest overburden from cosmic rays, as the
surrounding water provides support for a lightweight detector structure. By removing the need for
underground excavation and expensive structural support, the cost of construction can be
dramatically reduced.

Additionally, the common practice of building majority bespoke components is replaced by using
modern commercially available components wherever possible. The number of expensive elements, such
as photomultiplier tubes is also reduced by only considering accelerator beam neutrino events,
such that full coverage high-density detector instrumentation is not required.

Furthermore, \chips detectors are not only designed to be cheap but practical. Easy to build,
quick to deploy, and upgradable once operational, multiple detector modules can be flexibly
combined depending on available resources. When compared to DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande both
requiring a large upfront budget and many years to construct, cheap \chips detector modules can be
deployed as needed in under a year by a relatively small team.

To date, \chips R\&D efforts have been based in the USA to exploit the NuMI beam before the end of
its lifetime. Future plans are focused on the scaling of \chips detectors for the deployment of
multiple modules within the LBNF beam once operational. Collaborators from primarily University
College London, The University of Wisconsin Madison and Nikhef are focused on multiple R\&D
efforts, outlined below, each aiming to prove the viability of a crucial component of the \chips
concept.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Detector construction:} This effort aims to prove that the construction and
          deployment of \chips concept detectors are possible. Two prototype detectors have so far
          been deployed. Firstly, the small (\unit{3.3}{\mathrm{m}} high) \chipsm detector,
          deployed into a flooded mine pit located in northern Minnesota during the summer of
          2014, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:chips_m}~\cite{perch2015, pfutznerProto2017,
              pfutzner2017}. Secondly, the much larger \unit{5}{\mathrm{kt}} \chipsfive detector,
          deployed into the same pit during the summer of 2019 and detailed in
          Section.~\ref{sec:chips_detector}.

    \item \textbf{Water filtration:} This effort aims to prove that adequate water purity can be
          achieved using cheap, commercially available filtration. Extensive studies have proven
          that by filtering water directly from bodies of water on the Earth's surface (including
          flooded mine pits), adequate photon attenuation lengths, greater than
          \unit{50}{\mathrm{m}} are achievable~\cite{amat2017, campbell2020}.

    \item \textbf{Physics sensitivity:} This effort aims to prove that \chips concept detectors
          (even the prototypes) can provide significant physics contributions alone or alongside
          the current and next generation of experiments. Single modules in the current NuMI beam
          (discussed in Section.~\ref{sec:chips_concept_beam}) and multiple modules in the future
          LBNF beam have been considered in multiple studies~\cite{pfutzner2017, adde2016,
              lang2015}.

    \item \textbf{Data acquisition:} This effort aims to prove that a cheap data acquisition
          system using commercially available components and software is viable~\cite{eijk2018}.
          Outlined in Chapter.~\ref{chap:daq}, \chips implements a novel use of cheap single-board
          computers to collect photomultiplier tube data.

    \item \textbf{Event reconstruction and classification:} This effort aims to prove that modern
          machine learning techniques can be successfully applied to large water Cherenkov
          concepts such as \chips. Detailed as the primary contribution of this thesis in
          Chapter.~\ref{chap:cvn}, this work feeds directly into both the physics sensitivity work
          mentioned above and detailed detector module optimisation studies.

\subsection{The neutrino beam and off-axis alignment} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:chips_concept_beam} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\chips detectors will primarily study the appearance of $\nu_{e}$ oscillating from $\nu_{\mu}$
over a long baseline. To generate a sufficient number of GeV scale $\nu_{\mu}$, a high-intensity
accelerator beam is required. Currently, only two such beams exist, the J-PARC based beam in Japan
used by the T2K experiment and the \numi beam in the USA used by \nova. Here we describe the
\numi~\cite{adamson2016} (Neutrinos at the Main Injection) beam as it is directly relevant to
current \chips efforts. However, it is essential to note that \chips detectors are designed to be
used in any neutrino beam, including the future \numi replacement, LBNF.

The \numi beam is an accelerator muon neutrino beam produced at Fermilab near Chicago in the USA.
Beginning operation in 2005 for the MINOS experiment, \numi was upgraded in 2013 to provide a
higher intensity and energy, principally to achieve peak energy near the $\sim$\unit{1.5}{\GeV}
$\nu_{\mu}\rightarrow\nu_{e}$ oscillation maximum for \nova. Currently the \numi beam achieves an
intensity above \unit{700}{\mathrm{kW}} (\unit{740}{\mathrm{kW}} peak) making it the most powerful
such beam in the world. A schematic of the \numi beamline configuration is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:numi_beam}.

\begin{figure} % NUMI BEAM DIAGRAM %
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{diagrams/4-chips/numi_beam.png}
    \caption[Schematic of the main components of the \numi beam.]
    {Schematic of the main components of the \numi beam (not to scale) shown with dimensions.
        Figure taken from Ref.~\cite{adamson2016}. The MINOS and \nova near detectors and the
        MINERvA experiment are located just to the right of what is shown.}
    \label{fig:numi_beam}
\end{figure}

Every \unit{1.33}{\mathrm{seconds}} a \unit{10}{\mu\mathrm{s}} long spill of protons accelerated
to \unit{120}{\GeV} by the Main Injector are directed towards a stationary graphite target. The
resulting interactions within the target create a shower of secondary hadrons containing
predominantly pions and kaons. The hadrons are passed through a focusing system of two magnetic
horns tuned principally to focus charged pions along the beamline while rejecting other particles.
After focusing, the surviving hadrons are allowed to decay in flight to a beam of muon neutrinos
in a \unit{675}{\mathrm{m}} long decay pipe via the processes,
\begin{align} % NUMI DECAY EQUATIONS %
    \pi^{+} & \rightarrow\mu^{+}+\nu_{\mu}, \\
    K^{+}   & \rightarrow\mu^{+}+\nu_{\mu}. \\
    \label{eq:numi_decays}
\end{align}
The resulting muons also decay such that $\mu^{+}\rightarrow e^{+}+\nu_{e}+\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$
producing an intrinsic $\nu_{e}$ background (alongside other decays) as well as wrong sign
$\nu_{\mu}$ contamination. Alternatively, the polarity of the horns can be used to switch the
dominant sign of the hadrons focused, allowing \numi to operate as either a neutrino or
antineutrino beam. These two modes of operation are called \emph{forward horn current} and
\emph{reverse horn current} for primarily a neutrino or antineutrino beam composition
respectively. Any remaining hadrons, alongside electrons, muons and surviving primary protons are
absorbed by rock downstream of the decay pipe, leaving just the neutrino components of the beam.

Long baseline neutrino experiments typically consist of a \emph{near detector} to measure the beam
neutrino composition at source and a much larger \emph{far detector} to measure the oscillated
composition after a long distance. The \numi beamline contains three detectors just downstream of
\unit{300}{\mathrm{m}} of rock: The MINERvA spectrometer~\cite{mcfarland2006}, the near detector
for MINOS (now used by MINERvA), and the near detector for \nova. \chips prototypes within the
\numi beam will not have a dedicated near detector; therefore, data from the above detectors will
be crucial for physics analysis in order to constrain the beam composition and flux. However, any
future near detector for \chips, possibly within the LBNF beam should also be a water Cherenkov
detector, to reduce detector induced systematic uncertainties.

The \numi neutrino beam passes through the Earth's crust until it finally emerges in northern
Minnesota. This is where the MINOS, \nova, and prototype \chips far detectors are located (used to
be located in the MINOS case), as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:numi_map}. The Minnesota state nickname
`land of 10,000 lakes' is not an overstatement, there are a vast number of potential lakes for
\chips detector deployment in this region. Additionally, intense iron ore mining on the `Iron
Range' provides many suitable disused (and now flooded) mine pits. The exact \chipsfive prototype
detector location is discussed in greater detail in Section.~\ref{sec:chips_detector}.

\begin{figure} % CHIPS LOCATION IN NUMI DIAGRAM %
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{diagrams/4-chips/numi_map.png}
    \caption[Map of detector locations in the \numi beam.]
    {Map of the MINOS, \nova and \chips locations in the \numi beam as it surfaces in northern
        Minnesota. Shown is the expected neutrino event rate assuming no oscillations, with lines
        of constant L/E indicated by contours. The western extent of Lake Superior can be seen in
        the lower right of the map. Image taken from Ref.\cite{adamson2013}.}
    \label{fig:numi_map}
\end{figure}

Due to the kinematics of pion decay, whether the far detector is placed directly on the beam axis
or not can have a significant impact on the observed energy spectrum of beam neutrinos as shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:numi_axis}. For neutrinos directly on the beam axis, there is a strong energy
dependence on the parent pion energy. However, as the off-axis angle increases, the neutrino
energy is less dependent on the parent pion energy and becomes restricted to a narrowing range of
decreasing energies. This effect known as the \emph{off-axis effect} is used by both \nova and T2K
to create a narrower energy spectrum focused on the $\nu_{\mu}\rightarrow\nu_{e}$ oscillation
maximum. Additionally, by reducing the tail of higher-energy neutrinos, the number of background
NC events can be greatly reduced, as is the case for the \unit{7}{\mathrm{mrad}} off-axis
\chipsfive detector.

        Ref.~\cite{adamson2013}.}

\subsection{Water Cherenkov detectors} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:chips_concept_cherenkov} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The \chips detector concept is based upon the water Cherenkov technique for neutrino detection,
which has successfully been used multiple times by neutrino experiments. A large body of target
water is instrumented with photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to record the Cherenkov radiation produced
by sufficiently relativistic charged particles resulting from neutrino interactions. By using
readily available water as the target material and only instrumenting the volume surface, water
Cherenkov detectors provide the best detection methodology for maximising volume and reducing
cost.

Cherenkov radiation is emitted by all electrically charged particles travelling faster than the
local phase velocity of light in a dielectric medium. Similar to the sonic boom created by a
supersonic aircraft, Cherenkov radiation forms a shock wave of coherent light, as shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:cherenkov}, typically with wavelengths in the ultraviolet and optical range. When
projected onto the detector wall, the resulting cone of radiation generates a distinctive ring
shape. The cone opening angle (the angle at which light is emitted) $\theta_{c}$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
    \cos\theta_{c} = \frac{1}{\beta n(\lambda)},
    \label{eq:cherenkov_angle}
\end{equation}
where $\beta=v/c$ and $n$ is the refractive index of the medium~\cite{particle2020}. Note that $n$
is a function of the wavelength of emission $\lambda$, and so is the opening angle. As the
refractive index of water is $\sim 1.33$ for typical wavelengths of emission, and using the
ultrarelativistic limit $\beta\sim 1$ the opening angle is found to be $\sim41^{\circ}$.

\begin{figure} % CHERENKOV EFFECT DIAGRAM DIAGRAM %
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{diagrams/4-chips/cherenkov.png}
    \caption[Diagram of Cherenkov radiation emission.]
    {Diagram of Cherenkov radiation emission and wavefront angles. The angles $\theta_{c}$ and
        $\eta$ are not equal in a dispersive medium. Figure taken from Ref.~\cite{particle2020}}
    \label{fig:cherenkov}
\end{figure}

There is no Cherenkov emission when $\cos\theta_{c} > 1$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:cherenkov_angle}, which is
the case when $\beta n(\lambda)<1$. Therefore, there exists a Cherenkov energy threshold $E_{t}$
for charged particle, which when expressed in terms of the particle mass $m$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
    E_{t} = \gamma m = \frac{m}{\sqrt{1-(1/n)^{2}}}.
    \label{eq:cherenkov_threshold}
\end{equation}
Again using $n\sim 1.33$ this gives a typical threshold energy of $\sim1.5m$.

The number of Cherenkov photons emitted by a particle of charge $ze$ per unit wavelength per unit
path length is given by:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d^{2}N}{d\lambda dx}=\frac{2\pi\alpha z^{2}}{\lambda^{2}}
    \left(1-\frac{1}{1-\beta^{2}n^{2}(\lambda)}\right),
    \label{eq:cherenkov_emission}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is the fine structure constant~\cite{particle2020}. Integrating over the range of
wavelengths for which PMTs are typically sensitive, \unit{350}{\mathrm{nm}} to
\unit{650}{\mathrm{nm}}, and using $\beta\sim 1$ and $n\sim 1.33$ gives approximately $240$
photons emitted per cm travelled by the charged particle~\cite{perch2017}.

By analysing the Cherenkov ring (or rings) of light recorded by the PMTs on the walls of the
detector, information about the charged particle (particles) within an event can be determined.
The underlying neutrino interaction can then be understood indirectly. The primary challenge for
accelerator beam water Cherenkov detectors is the identification and reconstruction of an electron
or muon ring likely to have been produced initially from a beam neutrino and not a cosmic ray.
This indicates a beam CC $\nu_{e}$ or CC $\nu_{\mu}$ event respectively, rejecting NC and cosmic
events.

The basic shape of a Cherenkov ring can be used to tell which charged particle created it. Muons
are long-lived and typically travel many metres within the detector, producing a clean ring with
sharp edges. Conversely, electrons almost immediately initiate an electromagnetic shower;
therefore, the observed ring is the sum of all the rings produced from the individual electrons
and positrons within the shower. As a consequence, when compared to a muon ring, electron rings
are commonly wider and characteristically fuzzy. A factor of this difference can be seen in
Fig.~\ref{fig:emission distance}, which shows how the total amount of Cherenkov radiation is
emitted for both electrons and muons as a function of distance from the interaction vertex.

\begin{figure} % EMISSION DISTANCE DIAGRAM %
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{diagrams/4-chips/emission_distance.pdf}
    \caption[Fraction of Cherenkov photons emitted as a function of distance.]
    {The fraction of the total number of photons emitted as a function of the distance from the
        interaction vertex for both electrons and muons with an energy of \unit{2.5}{\GeV}. Note
        how the muon travels much further emitted an approximately constant amount of Cherenkov
        radiation as it does so.}
    \label{fig:emission distance}
\end{figure}

The situation becomes complicated when many charged particles above the Cherenkov threshold are
involved, which is common at higher energies. In this case, multiple overlapping rings are
observed, making reconstruction difficult. The worst-case scenario, however, is when two rings
entirely overlap, removing any ability to tell them apart. This is commonly the case for NC
interactions producing a $\pi^{0}$ in the final state, forming the primary background for CC
$\nu_{e}$ appearance analyses after CC $\nu_{\mu}$ rejection.

With a 98.82\% branching ratio $\pi^{0}$ particles decay to a pair of photons~\cite{particle2020}.
Both photons like electrons almost immediately initiate an electromagnetic shower, leading to two
electron like rings. The separation angle between the rings is then given by:
\begin{equation}
    (1-\cos\theta_{ij})=\frac{m_{\pi}^2}{2E_{i}E_{k}},
\end{equation}
where $m_{\pi}$ is the invariant mass of the $\pi^{0}$ and $E_{i}$ and $E_{j}$ are the energies of
the two photons respectively. Therefore, for a $\pi^{0}$ decaying to two \unit{1}{\GeV} photons,
there is just $\sim 8^{\circ}$ of separation between the rings, making them incredibly hard to
tell apart, especially when electron like rings are fuzzy. Conversely, if the two photons have an
unequal energy distribution, such that one is much more energetic than the other, the higher
energy photon ring can dominate, and the other can not be identified, leading to what looks like a
single electron ring.

\section{The \chipsfive detector} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:chips_detector} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The \chipsfive detector is the first large scale prototype module for the \chips project. A
cylindrical detector \unit{25}{\mathrm{m}} in diameter and \unit{12}{\mathrm{m}} high, \chipsfive
has a total inner surface area of \unit{1924}{\mathrm{m}^2} and a total target mass of
\unit{5.9}{\mathrm{kton}}. Via the process of design, construction, deployment, and data
acquisition, the primary \chipsfive aim is to refine the \chips concept for future full-scale
($\sim$\unit{15}{\mathrm{kton}}) modules. The \chipsfive detector is designed to be fully
characteristic of what a full-sized \chips module is envisioned to be; therefore, the details
outlined here are representative of what to expect for such a module.

\subsection{Location} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:chips_detector_location} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\chipsfive is located at the Wentworth 2W pit in northern Minnesota, USA, near the small town of
Hoyt Lakes. A disused and flooded surface Taconite ore (a type of iron ore) mine pit, the centre
of Wentworth 2W is located \unit{7}{\mathrm{mrad}} off the \numi beam axis at a distance of
\unit{712}{\mathrm{km}} from the beam target. Roughly $0.8\mathrm{km}\times1.2\mathrm{km}$ in size
with a maximum depth of \unit{60}{\mathrm{m}} ($\pm3\mathrm{m}$ throughout the year), the pit
entirely freezes over in winter, allowing for work to only take place during the summer months
(May to October).

The \chipsfive detector module is first constructed on land and then deployed into the pit, as
discussed further in Section.~\ref{sec:chips_detector_deployment}. For this purpose, a large earth
ramp on the south side of the Wentworth 2W pit is used for construction. Due to the heavy
infrastructure in place for mining, the construction site is easily accessible by road (except for
the last \unit{200}{\mathrm{m}}) and is well connected to power. Additionally, the nearby PolyMet
mining administration building is used as a laboratory environment for construction and testing of
individual components before installation within the detector. A labelled satellite view of
Wentworth 2W is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:pit} for context, with a picture of the construction site
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:from_the_sky}.

        shows the \chipsfive detector size to scale.}

        bottom of the construction ramp. The two white shore huts can just be seen halfway up the
        ramp.}
    \label{fig:from_the_sky}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Structure} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:chips_detector_structure} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The structure of the \chipsfive detector module consists primarily of two \unit{26}{\mathrm{m}}
diameter and \unit{1.2}{\mathrm{m}} high lightweight stainless steel \emph{endcaps} that form the
top and bottom of the cylindrical shape. During construction the conveniently named \emph{top-cap}
is held above the \emph{bottom-cap} by \unit{1.5}{\mathrm{m}} steel struts as shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:frame}, allowing for the endcap instrumentation to be installed as detailed in
Section.~\ref{sec:chips_detector_instrumentation}.

During construction on land the top-cap and bottom-cap are connected by 28 \unit{12}{\mathrm{m}}
long Dyneema cables around their perimeter. With the addition of forty \unit{16}{\mathrm{inch}}
diameter air-filled and sealed PVC pipes crisscrossing the top-cap frame, the top-cap is made
buoyant. Once deployed into the pit, the bottom-cap sinks while the top-cap floats, holding the
Dyneema cable taut, and forming the final detector shape, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:chips_render}.

This highlights one of the clear advantages of the \chips concept, no structure on the vertical
cylindrically wall of the detector is required. In addition to the deployment advantages discussed
in Section~\ref{sec:chips_detector_deployment}, and the significantly easier engineering, this is
the key reason as to why a cylindrical detector is chosen over a spherical one.

Also during construction on land, a light and watertight liner is installed. Designed to isolate
the clean internal detector water from the external pit water and to prevent non Cherenkov light
from reaching the PMTs, the liner is made from geomembrane, a flexible reinforced polymer
membrane. Commercially available in large rolls the liner is welded together during construction
to form the top, bottom, and sides. Note that the sides are installed onshore with enough loose so
that when deployed they are held nearly taut (the Dyneema takes the strain).

        top-cap and bottom-cap together.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Instrumentation} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:chips_detector_instrumentation} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

- PVC planes, holding 15 or 30 PMTs depending on density location in detector, PVC pipe,
connectors and glue are commercially available. They are tiled together within the detector
attached directly to stainless steel stringers on the endcaps or the Dyneema cables running down
the sides. Called Planar Optical Modules (POMs) or planes, Two types of planes, different readout
electronics.

- Needs to able to cope with 4 degrees at bottom!

- PMTs angle at \unit{45}{^\circ} to the beam, inward facing PMTs, 88 mm HZC PMTs with electronics
from the KM3NeT experiment and 3 inch Hamamatsu R6091 provided by the NEMO3 experiment with
electronics developed by \chips in collaboration with Icecube in Madison. R6091 PMTs use a
Cockroft-Walton board that generates a positive voltage, to hold the anode at a positive charged
and keep the cathode grounded. This is done as the PMTs make direct contact with the water within
the detector volume which can attract electrons within the PMT to the glass causing glass
scintillation and significant noise. It has been found that we don't need as high coverage as
Super-Kamiokande for example as we are looking at higher energy events, due to the higher light
yield from each event. Just looking at forward-going beam events so can have different coverage
throughout the detector. Smaller PMTs compared to 20 inch SUper-Kamiokande, time resolution is
better and they are no more expensive per photocathode area. All 88 mm HZC PMTs are instrumented
with light cones, circular reflector at \unit{45}{^\circ} to the PMT direction that increase the
amount of light gathered. Reflective disks attached to plastic cones that connect to the PMT
insert. Potted PMTs within transparent plastic, transparent potting material. High quantum
efficiency and low quantum efficiency, max 24.4\% vs 12.0\% at \unit{400}{\mathrm{nm}}

- PMTs are not distributed uniformly there are three regions of interest, a high-density region
downstream where the vast majority of beam events hit, a low-density region, and a region for
Madison planes used to help reject cosmics NC events which are less along the beamline. There is
also a veto volume with PMTs pointing upward for the top endcap planes. light-tight sheet
seperates the inner volume from the top veto volume of the detector. For calibration "flashers"
are built into the detector to allow for known location light generation to calibrate final PMT
positions and time resolutuions.

- Data Acquisition PMT readout and everything like that is discussed in the next chapter.

\subsection{Water clarity} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:chips_detector_water} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

- Though remarkably clear the Wentworth pit water is not clean enough for the detector volume
where we require ~30m attenuation length. Need to pump water, to prevent algae blooms and
bacterial growth and remove particulates which are present in the water to begin with. An
umbilical resting on the pit floor will contain 2 fibres, 2 power cables and 2 flexible pipes for
filtering the internal water on shore. All connected to two shore huts, one for filtering and one
for data acquisition.
- Any pressure differences on the liner are negligible, but a small positive pressure is kept
inside the detector to prevent particulates coming in via and leaks etc...

\subsection{Deployment} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:chips_detector_deployment} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

- How it can grow if needed - buoyant top cap anchored to the bottom one, which when fully
deployed will rest on the bottom of the pit.

\section{Monte Carlo event generation and simulation} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:chips_monte_carlo} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

- Indispensable tool in particle physics, during the design and data analysis stages. Allows for
optimisation studies, testing of event reconstruction techniques and the study of potential
physics sensitivity.
- Useful MC simulation will provide output matching observables in a real detector. For full
analysis simulations need to be validated fully to make sure they approximate reality well enough.

- We take full advantage of the MINOS, \nova extensive simulations of the \numi beam for use in
CHIPS.
- The tau neutrino component is negligible and not predicted by the simulation

DIAGRAM: expected cosmic rate at different height plot
DIAGRAM: Cosmic rate given the water overburden diagram
- \unit{50}{\mathrm{m}} of overburden,
- CR muon rate
- In-spill CR occupancy
- CR event dead time

- These short spills are essential for \chips and other experiments in rejecting the massive
cosmic ray background. As all events outside the expected beam spill window at the detector can be
rejected.

\subsection{Detector simulation} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:chips_monte_carlo_sim} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

- Geant4 framework, based on WCSim package, designed to allow easy creation of generic water
Cherenkov models in Geant4, extensively modified for \chips, mainly by adding additional features
to simplify the process of creating and loading different geometries to allow for faster testing
of deign ideas without needing to recompile. Does this with XML configuration files, for PMTs,
lightcones, geometries etc... QGSP BIC HP physics list, default for this type of detector in
geant4, 50.0m at 405.0nm attenuation length in water, material properties hardcoded, but can be
scaled by the configuration, come from Super-Kamiokande simulation, configuration loaded at
runtime, layout of PMTs defined in a unit cell containing any number of PMTs of any type, detector
walls are tiled with copies of the unit cell in zones, allowing for different regions of different
PMT density. and type. PMT glass thickness, diameter, protrusion distance, appropriate rayleigh
and mie scattering are included as well as blacksheet, photocathode reflectivity.

- Simulation simulates the passage of a generated events primary particles through the detector
assigning a random vertex atleast 1m away from the detector wall as its interaction vertex. When a
PMT is hit a

- The "signal" in all cases are CC interactions, therefore selection of nuel, anuel, numu and
anumu CC is the goal.
- Main background in CC numu selections are NC with charged pions.
- Main background in CC nuel selections is pi-zero NC, which can mimic the chracteristic EM
shower, due to its near certain decay into two photons.
- You get a small number of nuel intrinsic to the beam, they are just a background as they are
indistinguishabe from the nuel appreaence neutrinos.
- Once you have collected samples in all four cases, a fit is performed to the reconstructed
neutrino energy distributions to extract the four neutrino oscillation parameters.
