\section{The \chips concept} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:chips_concept} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

- General overview of why a large, cheap detector like CHIPS is needed
- Brief overview of what CHIPS could add to physics, what it can detect etc...
- general non-detailed description of the general principles behind CHIPS
- CHIPS a large, yet cost-effective water chereknov detector concept, to initially run in the
\numi beam line.
- Will be deployed in a flooded mine pit, which removes the necessity and expense of a substantial
external structure to support the large detector mass.
- Can easily be deployed in the LBNF beam once operational.
- Instead of deploying very large single detectors which would be impractical, you can deploy
multiple independent cylindrical units.
- The detector height is then constrained by the depth of the water and the cosmic overburden
requirements.

\subsection{The \chipsm detector} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:chips_concept_m} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

- Andy CHIPS-M prototype construction and simulations~\cite{perch2015}

- If one photon has a much lower energy than the other, or they are very closely overlapped,
they are commonly misidentified as a single electron.
- The shape of the ring can then be used for particle identification
- Muon rings tend to be sharper and exhibit a `plateau' shape as they emmit a constant amount of
Cherenkov radiation from a single particle over a period of time.
- Electron rings are more diffuse due to their production being from a electromagnetic shower.

\section{Cherenkov radiation} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:chips_cherenkov} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    \caption[Diagram of Cherenkov radiation.]
    {Diagram of Cherenkov radiation emission and wavefront angles. The angles $\theta_{c}$ and
        $\eta$ are not equal in a dispersive medium. Figure taken from Ref.~\cite{particle2020}
    }
    \label{fig:cherenkov}
\end{figure}

- Charged particle emit Cherenkov radiation if their velocity is greater than the local phase
velocity of light in the medium through which they are travelling.
- The angle at which the Cherenkov radiation is emmited relative to the particles direction of
travel is given by Ref.~\cite{particle2020}
\begin{equation}
    cos\theta_{c} = \frac{1}{n\beta}
\end{equation}
- Where n is the refractive index of the medium and $\beta=v/c$
- n is actually a function of the light wavelength $\lambda$

- The refractive index of water is very close to 1.33 in the relevant wavelength range, which for
ultrarelativistic particles with $\beta\approx 1$ gives a value of $\theta_{c}\approx 41^{\circ}$

- The threshold velocity for Cherenkov emmision is $\beta_{t}=1/n$

    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{diagrams/4-chips/emission_distance.pdf}
    \caption[Fraction of Cherenkov photons emitted as a function of distance.]
    {The fraction of the total number of photons emitted as a function of the distance from the
        interaction vertex for both electrons and muons. Note how the muon travels much further
        emitted an approximately constant amount of Cherenkov radiation as it does so.}
    \label{fig:emission distance}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure} % EMISSION PROFILE DIAGRAM %
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{diagrams/4-chips/emission_profile.pdf}
    \caption[Emission profiles for both electrons and muons]
    {Emission profiles for both electrons (left) and muons (right). They show the fraction of the
        total number of emitted photons as a function of both the distance travelled from the
        interaction vertex and the angle of emission for each photon.}
    \label{fig:emission_profile}
\end{figure}

- The interaction of primary concern are NC interactions that produce a pi-zero
- They decay to a pair of photons with a branching ratio of 98.82\% reference
- And these will then pair-produce forming e-plus, e-minus pairs, each producing an EM shower
leading to two electron like rings.
- For a boosted pi-zero the separation angle, $\theta_{ij}$ between the rings is given by
\begin{equation}
    (1-\cos\theta_{ij})=\frac{m_{\pi}^2}{2E_{i}E_{k}}
\end{equation}
Where $m_{\pi}$ is the invariant mass of the $\pi^{0}$ and $E_{i}$ and $E_{j}$ are the energies
of the two photons respectively.
Therefore for a pi-zero decaying to two 1000 MeV photons gives a separation angle of
$\approx 8^{\circ}$. This creates two overlapping rings of hits picked up by the detector pmts
which can prove difficult to separate.

- TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENT TYPE OF INTERACTIONS AT HOW THEY MANIFEST DUE TO CHERENKOV RADIATION!!!

\section{The \chipsfive detector} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:chips_detector} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

- The chips-5 detector is the first of these units, at 25m in diameter and 12m tall.
- This leads to a fiducial volume of ~5kton
- Will be initially deployed into the Wentworth Pit 2W in northen minnesota, which is 7 mrad
off-axis of the \numi beam.
- Also deep enough to allow for ~50m of everburden of water to reduce the cosmic background.
- Not at the ideal location (baseline) to measure the mass hierarchy in the \numi beam.
- Can help to constrain delta-cp by measuring electron neutrino appearance.
- Physics capabilities have been studied using GLoBES, should ask Tom for a nice plot and brief
description of how it all works.
- Wentworth 2W is a disused surface iron pit (taconite ore) owned by Cliffs natural resources.
- Has advantages of having the infastrucutre in place for heavy industry, such as power and roads.
- The main Polymet mining building is less than a mile from the deployment site which was used as
a laboratory environment for building detector compoenents on site.
- located at a latitude of 47.58N and longitude of 92.13W. It is 7 mrad off the centralaxis of the
\numi beam at a baseline of 712 km
- Water is drained from the pit in the spring to ensure it does not overflow during the summer
rainy season.
- Therefore, fluctutationsof +-3m are expected over the course of a year.
- A lighttight liner a polymer membrance is used to seperate the clean detector water from the
external pit water and isolate the detector volume.
- This detector will act as a proff of concept that the R\&D has been a success and the provide
possible improvements for future iterations.
- CHIPS will not initially have a near detector, however the use of NOVA one is possible if
required, but not important for now.
- You would really need a water cherenkov near detector, so it as simiar as possible as the far
detector.
- This allows the same event reco and PID minimising systematic uncertainties in the predicted
background at the far detector.
- Is prefered as it has the same neutrino interaction traget (water) ensuring efficiencies are
similar in both detector.
- However, it should be noted that a water cherenkov detector has never been proven in high
intensity environmenets such as the \numi beam (WTF is t2k then)
