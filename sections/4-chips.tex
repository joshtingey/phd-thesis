\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:chips_intro}
\begin{comment}
- General overview of why a large, cheap detector like CHIPS is needed
- Brief overview of what CHIPS could add to physics, what it can detect etc...
- general non-detailed description of the general principles behind CHIPS
- CHIPS a large, yet cost-effective water chereknov detector concept, to initially run in the
Numi beam line.
- Will be deployed in a flooded mine pit, which removes the necessity and expense of a substantial
external structure to support the large detector mass.
- Will be initially deployed into the Wentworth Pit 2W in northen minnesota, which is 7 mrad
off-axis of the numi beam.
- Also deep enough to allow for ~50m of everburden of water to reduce the cosmic background.
- Can easily be deployed in the LBNF beam once operational.
- Can help to constrain delta-cp by measuring electron neutrino appearance.
- Not at the ideal location (baseline) to measure the mass hierarchy in the Numi beam.
- Physics capabilities have been studied using GLoBES, should ask Tom for a nice plot and brief
description of how it all works.
- Calculations indicate there will be 3.7 nutau CC interactions per kton per year. Leading to
~0.35 additional background effects per kton per year once selections are applied.
- Wentworth 2W is a disused surface iron pit (taconite ore) owned by Cliffs natural resources.
- Has advantages of having the infastrucutre in place for heavy industry, such as power and roads.
- The main Polymet mining building is less than a mile from the deployment site which was used as
a laboratory environment for building detector compoenents on site.
- located at a latitude of 47.58N and longitude of 92.13W. It is 7 mrad off the centralaxis of the
NuMI beam at a baseline of 712 km
- Water is drained from the pit in the spring to ensure it does not overflow during the summer
rainy season.
- Therefore, fluctutationsof +-3m are expected over the course of a year.
- Need to include the expected cosmic ray plots
DIAGRAM: expected cosmic rate at different height plot
- Instead of deploying very large single detectors which would be impractical, you can deploy
multiple independent cylindrical units.
- The detector height is then constrained by the depth of the water and the cosmic overburden
requirements.
- The chips-5 detector is the first of these units, at 25m in diameter and 12m tall.
- This leads to a fiducial volume of ~5kton
- A lighttight liner a polymer membrance is used to seperate the clean detector water from the
external pit water and isolate the detector volume.
- CHIPS uses high quantum efficiency PMTs from Hamamatsu
REF: Get hamamatsu PMT reference
INFO: detector module
- Dimensions
- Inner surface area
- PMT diameter
- photocathode coverage in different regions
- No of PMTs
- overburden
- CR muon rate
- In-spill CR occupancy
- CR event dead time
- Veto dimensions
- Veto num PMTs
- veto photocathode coverage
- veto pmt diameter

- Give full description of how each plane is constructed, how they are attached to the detector.
- Full description of the detector structure
- Full description of deployment/construction procedure
- Description of how the liner is built etc
- Though remarkably clear the Wentworth pit water is not clean enough for the detector volume
where we require ~30m attenuation length.
- This detector will act as a proff of concept that the R&D has been a success and the provide
possible improvements for future iterations.
- CHIPS will not initially have a near detector, however the use of NOVA one is possible if
required, but not important for now.
- You would really need a water cherenkov near detector, so it as simiar as possible as the far
detector.
- This allows the same event reco and PID minimising systematic uncertainties in the predicted
background at the far detector.
- Is prefered as it has the same neutrino interaction traget (water) ensuring efficiencies are
similar in both detector.
- However, it should be noted that a water cherenkov detector has never been proven in high
intensity environmenets such as the Numi beam (WTF is t2k then)
- For calibration "flashers" are built into the detector to allow for known location light
generation to calibrate final PMT positions and time resolutuions.
- We take full advantage of the MINOS, NOVA extensive simulations of the Numi beam for use in
CHIPS.
