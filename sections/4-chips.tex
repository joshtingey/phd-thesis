\chapter{The \chips R\&D Project} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{chap:chips}

In pursuit of answers to the open questions outlined in the previous chapter, neutrino experiments
are becoming increasingly, and possibly prohibitively, expensive and impractical. This is
particularly true of the next generation of long baseline experiments, DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande,
with cost estimates reaching billions of dollars and construction times greater than half a decade
long. It is also telling that these two future experimental neutrino projects receive the vast
majority of global research effort, such is their complexity, cost, and lead time.

It is clear that for detectors to remain practical and affordable into the future, a novel
approach to neutrino detector design is highly desirable. This is especially the case if megaton
scale detectors are ever to become a reality. While instrumentation will continue to improve with
time, the statistics of low event counts will always limit neutrino experiments until vastly
larger detectors can be built. Therefore, current R\&D efforts must focus on such detectors while
also attempting to complement the current and upcoming generation of experiments.

The \chips R\&D project~\cite{adamson2013} aims to develop novel strategies and technologies for
very large yet `cheap as chips' water Cherenkov detectors. Primarily aimed for deployment in long
baseline accelerator beam scenarios, \chips aims to lower the construction cost per kt of fiducial
mass to between \$200k-\$300k. For comparison, the Super-Kamiokande detector reached a cost of
approximately \$4 million/kt to build. As physics sensitivity depends on more than just fiducial
volume, this comparison is not entirely rigorous; however, it highlights the scale of cost savings
possible.

This chapter aims to describe the fundamental aspects of the \chips R\&D project in detail.
Firstly, the \chips concept will be outlined along with neutrino beam and Cherenkov detector
physics for context. The design, construction, deployment, and status of the \chipsfive detector
will then follow. Finally, the Monte Carlo event generation and detector simulation framework will
be discussed to aid the discussion of work presented in later chapters of this thesis.

\section{\chips concept} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:chips_concept} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The \chips concept is to construct cylindrical water Cherenkov detectors that can be sunk to the
bottom of deep bodies of water on the Earth's surface, such as lakes, reservoirs and flooded mine
pits. The water above the sunken detector provides a modest overburden from cosmic rays, while the
surrounding water provides support for a lightweight detector structure. By removing the need for
underground excavation and expensive structural support, the cost of construction can be
dramatically reduced.

Additionally, the common practice of building majority bespoke components is replaced by using
modern commercially available components wherever possible. The number of expensive elements, such
as photomultiplier tubes is also reduced by only considering accelerator beam neutrino events,
such that full coverage high-density detector instrumentation is not required.

Furthermore, \chips detectors are not only designed to be cheap but practical. Easy to build,
quick to deploy, and upgradable once operational, multiple detector modules can be flexibly
combined depending on available resources. When compared to DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande both
requiring a large upfront budget and many years to construct, cheap \chips detector modules can be
flexibly deployed in under a year by a relatively small team.

To date, \chips R\&D efforts have been based in the USA to exploit the NuMI beam before the end of
its lifetime. Future plans are focused on the scaling \chips detectors for the deployment of
multiple modules within the LBNF beam once operational. Collaborators from primarily University
College London, The University of Wisconsin Madison and Nikhef are focused on multiple R\&D
efforts outlined below, each aiming to prove the viability of a crucial component of the \chips
concept.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Detector construction:} This effort aims to prove that the construction and
          deployment of \chips concept detectors are possible. Two prototype detectors have so far
          been deployed. Firstly, the small \chipsm detector~\cite{perch2015, pfutznerProto2017,
              pfutzner2017}, deployed into a flooded mine pit located in northern Minnesota during the
          summer of 2014, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:chips_m}. Secondly, the much larger
          \unit{5}{\mathrm{kt}} \chipsfive detector, deployed into the same pit during the summer
          of 2019 and detailed in Section.~\ref{sec:chips_detector}.

    \item \textbf{Water filtration:} This effort aims to prove that adequate water purity can be
          achieved using cheap, commercially available filtration. Extensive
          studies~\cite{amat2017, campbell2020} have proven that by filtering water directly from
          bodies of water on the Earth's surface (including flooded mine pits), adequate photon
          attenuation lengths, greater than \unit{50}{\mathrm{m}} are achievable.

    \item \textbf{Detector sensitivity:} This effort aims to prove that \chips concept detectors
          (even prototypes) can provide significant physics contributions alone or alongside the
          current and next generation of experiments. Single detectors in the current NuMI beam
          (discussed in Section.~\ref{sec:chips_concept_beam}) and multiple detectors in the
          future LBNF beam have been considered in multiple studies~\cite{pfutzner2017, adde2016,
              lang2015}.

    \item \textbf{Data acquisition:} This effort aims to prove that a cheap data acquisition
          system using commercially available components and software is viable~\cite{eijk2018}.
          Outlined in Chapter.~\ref{chap:daq}, \chips implements a novel use of cheap single-board
          computers to collect photomultiplier tube data.

    \item \textbf{Event reconstruction and classification:} This effort aims to prove that modern
          machine learning techniques can be successfully applied to large water Cherenkov
          detector concepts such as \chips. Outlined as the primary contribution of this thesis in
          Chapter.~\ref{chap:cvn}, this work feeds directly into both the detector sensitivity
          work mentioned above and detailed detector optimisation studies.

\subsection{The neutrino beam and off-axis alignment} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:chips_concept_beam} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\chips detectors will primarily study the appearance of $\nu_{e}$ oscillating from $\nu_{\mu}$
over a long baseline. In order to generate a sufficient number of GeV scale $\nu_{\mu}$, a
high-intensity accelerator beam is required. Currently, only two such beams exist, the J-PARC
based beam in Japan used by the T2K experiment and the \numi beam in the USA used by \nova. Here
we describe the \numi~\cite{adamson2016} (Neutrinos at the Main Injection) beam as it is directly
relevant to current \chips efforts. However, it is essential to note that \chips is designed to be
used in any neutrino beam, including the future \numi replacement, LBNF.

The \numi beam is an accelerator muon neutrino beam produced at Fermilab near Chicago in the USA.
Initially beginning operation in 2005 for the MINOS experiment, \numi was upgraded in 2013 to
provide a higher intensity and energy, principally to achieve peak energy near the \unit{2}{\GeV}
oscillation maximum for \nova. Currently the \numi beam achieves an intensity above
\unit{700}{\mathrm{kW}} (\unit{740}{\mathrm{kW}} peak) making it the most powerful beam in the
world. A schematic of the \numi beamline configuration is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:numi_beam}.

\begin{figure} % NUMI BEAM DIAGRAM %
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{diagrams/4-chips/numi_beam.png}
    \caption[Schematic of the main components of the \numi beam.]
    {Schematic of the main components of the \numi beam (not to scale) shown with dimensions.
        Figure taken from Ref.~\cite{adamson2016}. The MINOS and \nova near detectors and the
        MINERvA experiment are located just to the right of what is shown.}
    \label{fig:numi_beam}
\end{figure}

Every \unit{1.33}{\mathrm{seconds}} a \unit{10}{\mu\mathrm{s}} long spill of protons accelerated
to \unit{120}{\GeV} by the Main Injector are directed towards a stationary graphite target. The
resulting interactions within the target create a shower of secondary hadrons containing
predominantly pions and kaons. The hadrons are passed through a focusing system of two magnetic
horns tuned principally to focus charged pions along the beamline while rejecting other particles.
After focusing, the surviving hadrons are allowed to decay in flight to a beam of muon neutrinos
in a \unit{675}{\mathrm{m}} long decay pipe via the processes,
\begin{align} % NUMI DECAY EQUATIONS %
    \pi^{+} & \rightarrow\mu^{+}+\nu_{\mu}  \\
    K^{+}   & \rightarrow\mu^{+}+\nu_{\mu}. \\
    \label{eq:numi_decays}
\end{align}
The resulting muons also decay such that $\mu^{+}\rightarrow e^{+}+\nu_{e}+\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$
producing an intrinsic $\nu_{e}$ background (alongside other decays) as well as wrong sign
$\nu_{\mu}$ contamination. Alternatively, the polarity of the horns can be used to switch the
dominant sign of the hadrons focused, allowing \numi to operate as either a neutrino or
antineutrino beam. These two modes of operation are called \emph{forward horn current} and
\emph{reverse horn current} for primarily a neutrino or antineutrino beam composition
respectively. Any remaining hadrons, alongside electrons, muons and surviving primary protons are
absorbed in rock downstream of the decay pipe, leaving just the neutrino components of the beam.

Long baseline neutrino experiments typically consist of a \emph{near detector} to measure the beam
neutrino composition at source and a much larger \emph{far detector} to measure the oscillated
composition after a long distance. The \numi beamline contains three detectors just downstream of
\unit{300}{\mathrm{m}} of rock: The MINERvA spectrometer~\cite{mcfarland2006}, the near detector
for MINOS (now used by MINERvA), and the near detector for \nova. \chips prototypes within the
\numi beam will not have a dedicated near detector; therefore, data from the above detectors will
be crucial for physics analysis in order to constrain the beam composition and flux.

The \numi neutrino beam passes through the Earth's crust until it finally emerges in northern
Minnesota. This is where the MINOS, \nova, and prototype \chips far detectors are located (used to
be located in the MINOS case), as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:numi_map}. The Minnesota state nickname
`land of 10,000 lakes' is not an overstatement, there are a huge number of potential lakes for
\chips detector deployment in this region. Additionally, intense iron ore mining activity on the
`Iron Range' provides many suitable disused (and now flooded) mine pits. The exact \chipsfive
prototype detector location is discussed in greater detail in Section.~\ref{sec:chips_detector}.

\begin{figure} % CHIPS LOCATION IN NUMI DIAGRAM %
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{diagrams/4-chips/numi_map.png}
    \caption[Map of detector locations in the \numi beam.]
    {Map of the MINOS, \nova and \chips locations in the \numi beam as it surfaces in northern
        Minnesota. Shown is the expected neutrino event rate assuming no oscillations, with lines
        of constant L/E indicated by contours. The western extent of Lake Superior can be seen in
        the lower right of the map. Image taken from Ref.\cite{adamson2013}.}
    \label{fig:numi_map}
\end{figure}

Due to the kinematics of pion decay, whether the far detector is placed directly on the beam axis
or not can have a significant impact on the observed energy spectrum of beam neutrinos as shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:numi_axis}. For neutrinos directly on the beam axis, there is a strong energy
dependence on the parent pion energy. However, as the off-axis angle increases, the neutrino
energy is less dependent on the parent pion energy and becomes restricted to a narrowing range of
decreasing energies. This effect known as the \emph{off-axis effect} is used by both \nova and T2K
to create a narrower energy spectrum focused on the $\nu_{\mu}\rightarrow\nu_{e}$ oscillation
maximum. Additionally, by reducing the tail of higher-energy neutrinos, the number of background
NC events can be greatly reduced, as is the case for the \unit{7}{\mathrm{mrad}} off-axis
\chipsfive detector.

        Ref.~\cite{adamson2013}.}

\subsection{Water Cherenkov detectors} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:chips_concept_cherenkov} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The \chips detector concept is based upon the water Cherenkov technique for neutrino detection,
which has been successfully used many times by neutrino experiments. A large body of target water
is instrumented with photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to record the Cherenkov radiation produced by
sufficiently relativistic charged particles resulting from neutrino interactions. By using readily
available water as the target material and only instrumenting the volume surface, water Cherenkov
detectors provide the best methodology for maximising volume and reducing cost.

Cherenkov radiation is emitted by all electrically charged particles travelling faster than the
local phase velocity of light in a dielectric medium. Similar to the sonic boom created by a
supersonic aircraft, Cherenkov radiation forms a shock wave of coherent light, as shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:cherenkov}, typically with wavelengths in the ultraviolet and optical range. When
projected onto the detector wall, the resulting cone of radiation generates a distinctive ring
shape. The cone opening angle (the angle at which light is emitted) $\theta_{c}$ is given
by~\cite{particle2020}:
\begin{equation}
    \cos\theta_{c} = \frac{1}{\beta n(\lambda)},
    \label{eq:cherenkov_angle}
\end{equation}
where $\beta=v/c$ and $n$ is the refractive index of the medium. Note that $n$ is a function of
the wavelength of emission $\lambda$, and so is the opening angle. As the refractive index of
water is approximately $1.33$ for typical wavelengths of emission, and using the ultrarelativistic
limit $\beta\approx 1$ the opening angle is found to be $\theta_{c}\approx 41^{\circ}$.

\begin{figure} % CHERENKOV EFFECT DIAGRAM DIAGRAM %
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{diagrams/4-chips/cherenkov.png}
    \caption[Diagram of Cherenkov radiation emission.]
    {Diagram of Cherenkov radiation emission and wavefront angles. The angles $\theta_{c}$ and
        $\eta$ are not equal in a dispersive medium. Figure taken from Ref.~\cite{particle2020}}
    \label{fig:cherenkov}
\end{figure}

There is no Cherenkov emission when $\cos\theta_{c} > 1$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:cherenkov_angle}, which is
the case when $\beta n(\lambda)<1$. Therefore, there exists a Cherenkov energy threshold $E_{t}$
for every particle, which when expressed in terms of the particle mass $m$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
    E_{t} = \gamma m = \frac{m}{\sqrt{1-(1/n)^{2}}}.
    \label{eq:cherenkov_threshold}
\end{equation}
Again using $n\approx1.33$ this gives a typical threshold energy of approximately $1.5m$.

The number of Cherenkov photons emitted by a particle of charge $ze$ per unit wavelength per unit
path length is given by~\cite{particle2020}:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d^{2}N}{d\lambda dx}=\frac{2\pi\alpha z^{2}}{\lambda^{2}}
    \left(1-\frac{1}{1-\beta^{2}n^{2}(\lambda)}\right),
    \label{eq:cherenkov_emission}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is the fine structure constant. Integrating over the range of wavelengths for which
PMTs are typically sensitive \unit{350}{\mathrm{nm}} to \unit{650}{\mathrm{nm}}, and using the
$\beta\approx 1$ and $n\approx1.33$ gives approximately $240$ per cm travelled.

By analysing the Cherenkov cone (or cones) of light recorded by the PMTs on the walls of the
detector, information about the underlying neutrino interaction can be determined. For example,
the basic shape of a Cherenkov ring can be used to tell which charged particle created it. As
electrons initiate an electromagnetic shower almost immediately, the resulting cone is actually
the sum of all the cones from the individual electrons and positrons within the shower. When
compared to the ring produced from a long track muon, whose ring is the result of emission from a
single particle, electron rings are wider and characteristically fuzzy. As can be seen in
Fig.~\ref{fig:emission distance}. The muon ring produces a plateau or constant radiation across
the ring with sharper edges within the whole and on the outside.

\begin{figure} % EMISSION DISTANCE DIAGRAM %
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{diagrams/4-chips/emission_distance.pdf}
    \caption[Fraction of Cherenkov photons emitted as a function of distance.]
    {The fraction of the total number of photons emitted as a function of the distance from the
        interaction vertex for both electrons and muons with an energy of \unit{2.5}{\GeV}. Note
        how the muon travels much further emitted an approximately constant amount of Cherenkov
        radiation as it does so.}
    \label{fig:emission distance}
\end{figure}

The situation becomes more difficult when there are many charged particle above threshold within
an event. In this case multiple rings can overlap and reconstruction becomes much more difficult.
Particularly of concern for water cherenkov detectors is the case when rings overlap to such a
degree that you can not tell them apart

- The interaction of primary concern are NC interactions that produce a pi-zero
- They decay to a pair of photons with a branching ratio of 98.82\% reference
- And these will then pair-produce forming e-plus, e-minus pairs, each producing an EM shower
leading to two electron like rings.
- For a boosted pi-zero the separation angle, $\theta_{ij}$ between the rings is given by
\begin{equation}
    (1-\cos\theta_{ij})=\frac{m_{\pi}^2}{2E_{i}E_{k}}
\end{equation}
Where $m_{\pi}$ is the invariant mass of the $\pi^{0}$ and $E_{i}$ and $E_{j}$ are the energies
of the two photons respectively.
Therefore for a pi-zero decaying to two 1000 MeV photons gives a separation angle of
$\approx 8^{\circ}$. This creates two overlapping rings of hits picked up by the detector pmts
which can prove difficult to separate.
- If one photon has a much lower energy than the other, or they are very closely overlapped,
they are commonly misidentified as a single electron.
- The shape of the ring can then be used for particle identification
- Muon rings tend to be sharper and exhibit a `plateau' shape as they emit a constant amount of
Cherenkov radiation from a single particle over a period of time.
- Electron rings are more diffuse due to their production being from a electromagnetic shower

\section{The \chipsfive detector} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:chips_detector} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

- Will use this prototype detector to explain all the main detailed principles of a \chips
detector module.

- Disused Taconite mine pit!!!
- The chips-5 detector is the first of these units, at 25m in diameter and 12m tall.
- This leads to a fiducial volume of ~5kton
- Will be initially deployed into the Wentworth Pit 2W in northen minnesota, which is 7 mrad
off-axis of the \numi beam.
- Also deep enough to allow for ~50m of everburden of water to reduce the cosmic background.
- Not at the ideal location (baseline) to measure the mass hierarchy in the \numi beam.
- Can help to constrain delta-cp by measuring electron neutrino appearance.
- Physics capabilities have been studied using GLoBES, should ask Tom for a nice plot and brief
description of how it all works.
- Wentworth 2W is a disused surface iron pit (taconite ore) owned by Cliffs natural resources.
- Has advantages of having the infastrucutre in place for heavy industry, such as power and roads.
- The main Polymet mining building is less than a mile from the deployment site which was used as
a laboratory environment for building detector compoenents on site.
- located at a latitude of 47.58N and longitude of 92.13W. It is 7 mrad off the centralaxis of the
\numi beam at a baseline of 712 km
- Water is drained from the pit in the spring to ensure it does not overflow during the summer
rainy season.
- Therefore, fluctutationsof +-3m are expected over the course of a year.
- A lighttight liner a polymer membrance is used to seperate the clean detector water from the
external pit water and isolate the detector volume.
- This detector will act as a proff of concept that the R\&D has been a success and the provide
possible improvements for future iterations.
- CHIPS will not initially have a near detector, however the use of \nova one is possible if
required, but not important for now.
- You would really need a water cherenkov near detector, so it as simiar as possible as the far
detector.
- This allows the same event reco and PID minimising systematic uncertainties in the predicted
background at the far detector.
- Is prefered as it has the same neutrino interaction traget (water) ensuring efficiencies are
similar in both detector.
- However, it should be noted that a water cherenkov detector has never been proven in high
intensity environmenets such as the \numi beam (WTF is t2k then)

- The "signal" in all cases are CC interactions, therefore selection of nuel, anuel, numu and
anumu CC is the goal.
- Main background in CC numu selections are NC with charged pions.
- Main background in CC nuel selections is pi-zero NC, which can mimic the chracteristic EM
shower, due to its near certain decay into two photons.
- You get a small number of nuel intrinsic to the beam, they are just a background as they are
indistinguishabe from the nuel appreaence neutrinos.
- Once you have collected samples in all four cases, a fit is performed to the reconstructed
neutrino energy distributions to extract the four neutrino oscillation parameters.
