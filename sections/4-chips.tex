\chapter{The \chips R\&D Project} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{chap:chips}

In pursuit of answering the open questions outlined in the previous chapter, amongst others,
neutrino experiments are becoming increasingly, and possibly prohibitively, expensive and
impractical. This is particularly true of long baseline accelerator experiments, with the
traditional scaling approaches taken by DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande now resulting in multi billion
dollar cost estimates to achieve the required physics sensitivity. It is also telling that only
\emph{two} future projects receive the vast majority of the global research effort, such is their
complexity, cost and lead time.

It is clear that for detectors to remain practical and affordable into the future a novel approach
to detector design is required. This is particularly true if megaton scale detectors are to ever
become a reality. While high performance signal identification and reconstruction will always be
required, the statistics of low event counts will always limit neutrino experiments. Therefore,
R\&D efforts must focus on how to make very large detectors achievable, while complementing the
current and upcoming generation of experiments.

The \chips R\&D project~\cite{adamson2013} aims to developed novel strategies and technologies for
very large yet `cheap as chips' water Cherenkov detectors. Aimed primarily for deployment in long
baseline accelerator scenarios studying $\nu_{e}$ appearance, \chips aims to lower the
construction cost per kt of fiducial mass to between \$200k-\$300k. In comparison, the
Super-Kamiokande detector cost \$4 million/kt to build. A direct cost comparison such as this is
not fully rigorous as physics sensitivity depends on more than just fiducial volume. Additionally,
Super-Kamiokande was designed to study a broad range of neutrino physics unlike \chips. However,
for a similar expected performance in the $\nu_{e}$ appearance between both experiments, the cost
savings are still clear.

The \chips concept is to construct cylindrical water Cherenkov detectors that can be sunk to the
bottom of deep bodies of water on the Earth's surface, such as lakes, reservoirs, and flooded mine
pits. The water above the detector provides a modest overburden from cosmic rays, while the
surrounding water provides support for the lightweight detector structure. By removing the need
for underground excavation and expensive structural support, the cost of construction can be
dramatically reduced.

Additionally, to reduce costs further, the common practice of building bespoke components across
the entire detector is replaced with using modern commercially available components wherever
possible. By only considering accelerator beam neutrino events, the number of expensive components
such as photomultiplier tubes can also be greatly reduced to save money.

Furthermore, individual \chips detectors are designed to be easy to build, quick to deploy, and
upgradable once operational. Multiple such detectors, each between 10-20 kt in size are envisioned
to be deployed separately to reach the total target volume. Combined, these factors make the
\chips concept incredibly flexible to available funding when compared to projects such as DUNE and
Hyper-Kamiokande. Additional funding should allow for an additional detector module to be deployed
on a timespan of months, compared to the approximately decade long construction for DUNE and
Hyper-Kamiokande.

Various R\&D effort

R\&D efforts for \chips have been directed

Note that all current

So far, all \chips efforts have been based in the USA, with the aim of exploiting the NuMI beam
before the end of its lifetime. In the summer of 2014 a small prototype detector, \chipsm, shown
in Fig.~\ref{fig:chips_m} was deployed into a flooded mine pit in northern Minnesota. R\&D efforts
that have been completed or ongoing by \chips.

The R\&D efforts for the \chips project fall into four clear streams outlined below, each with the
primary goal of proving that a key part of the \chips concept is viable.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Detector construction:}
    \item \textbf{Water filtration:}
    \item \textbf{Detector sensitivity:}
    \item \textbf{Data acquisition:}
    \item \textbf{Event reconstruction and identification:}
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
    \item In the summer of 2014 a small prototype detector \chipsm~\cite{perch2015,
              pfutznerProto2017, pfutzner2017}, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:chips_m} was deployed into
          a flooded mine pit in northern Minnesota. The main aims of this prototype were to
          test the general concept and specific components to learn valuable lessons for
          larger \chips prototypes.

    \item Extensive studies to determine the attenuation length of water~\cite{amat2017,
              campbell2020} filtered using commercially available and cheap components. This has
          proved successful showing that adequate attenuation lengths are possible on a much
          reduced budget and using water originally from whichever location a \chips detector is
          deployed into. Not discussed in this work.

    \item \chips sensitivity, ~\cite{pfutzner2017, adde2016, lang2015}, recent work for multi
          detector. Not discussed in this work

    \item \chipsfive detector

    \item Novel DAQ such as this work, Madison~\cite{eijk2018}

    \item Novel reconstruction for water Cherenkov detectors, never been applied seriously before
          such as this work
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

- Currently all efforts have been based in the USA, using the NuMI beam generated at Fermilab.
Have deployed a small prototype chips-M, in 2019 summer deployed a much large 5kt detector in the
same lake. All of this is to demonstrate R\&D efforts. This detector has the benefit of
additionally being able to exploit that NuMI beam. Long term CHIPS can be scaled and deployed in
the LBNF/LBNE beam primarily for DUNE, as multiple detector modules.
- Long term CHIPS can be scaled a deployed as multiple detectors in the LBNE beam up to a megaton.
- Complement the expensive, underground, expensively instrumented detectors to focus on a specific
task rather than being fully general purpose.
- Can easily be deployed in the LBNF beam once operational.

\subsection{The neutrino beam} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:chips_concept_beam} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

- CHIPS will use a neutrino beam to measure,
- These can be measured using four data sample, two for neutrino and two for antineutrinos.
- These sample are produced by "Forward Horn current" FHC and "Reverse Horn current" RHC,
producing predominetetly neutrinos and anti-neutrinos respectively.
- Neutrino oscillation probabilities can then be inferred by comparisons of the observed neutrino
spectra and the near and far detectors.
- Primarily muon neutrinos can be produced by using a particle accelerator to direct a proton beam
at a target. By focusing the pions and kaons this produces, a neutrino beam created from the
downstream decays, creates the muon neutrino beam.
- Better to think of \chips applying to any Beam
- Here we will talk about the NuMI beam as the prime example as that is the one used for the
current generation of \chips prototype.
- Possible future \chips in LBNF which is primarily being built for DUNE
- The \numi beam big paper~\cite{adamson2016}
- How will LBNF be different from NuMI, upgrades etc...

\subsection{Water Cherenkov events} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:chips_concept_cherenkov} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

- Dissapearence channels sensitive to %abs(delta31^2), and sin^2(2theta23).
- Apperence channels sensitive to all four parameters including sign of %delta32^2.
- The "signal" in all cases are CC interactions, therefore selection of nuel, anuel, numu and
anumu CC is the goal.
- Main background in CC numu selections are NC with charged pions.
- Main background in CC nuel selections is pi-zero NC, which can mimic the chracteristic EM
shower, due to its near certain decay into two photons.
- You get a small number of nuel intrinsic to the beam, they are just a background as they are
indistinguishabe from the nuel appreaence neutrinos.
- Once you have collected samples in all four cases, a fit is performed to the reconstructed
neutrino energy distributions to extract the four neutrino oscillation parameters.

- CHERENKOV RADIATION -> PMTS -> TYPES OF EVENT (main problem ones etc...)

- Operate on the fact that charged particles travelling faster than the local speed of light in a
dielectric medium will emit photons due to the Cherenkov effect.
- Therefore water Cherenkov detectors consist of a large body of water instrumented with
photomultiplier tubes.
- A neutrino interacts with nucleon in thw water emitting a charged particle such as an electron or
muon.
- If particle is sufficiently relativistic it will emit Cherenkov radiation.
- The induced polarisation of the water molecules in the wake of the charged particle causes a
coherent shock wave of light to be emitted.
- Excite electron and atoms in its path which then must return to the ground state by emitting
radiation.
0 As the particle is faster than speed on light in medium the wavefront is in the shape of a cone
simlar to the wake behind a boat.

\begin{figure} % CHERENKOV EFFECT DIAGRAM DIAGRAM %
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{diagrams/4-chips/cherenkov.png}
    \caption[Diagram of Cherenkov radiation.]
    {Diagram of Cherenkov radiation emission and wavefront angles. The angles $\theta_{c}$ and
        $\eta$ are not equal in a dispersive medium. Figure taken from Ref.~\cite{particle2020}
    }
    \label{fig:cherenkov}
\end{figure}

- Charged particle emit Cherenkov radiation if their velocity is greater than the local phase
velocity of light in the medium through which they are travelling.
- The angle at which the Cherenkov radiation is emmited relative to the particles direction of
travel is given by Ref.~\cite{particle2020}
\begin{equation}
    cos\theta_{c} = \frac{1}{n\beta}
    \label{eq:cherenkov_angle}
\end{equation}
- Where n is the refractive index of the medium and $\beta=v/c$
- n is actually a function of the light wavelength $\lambda$
- The refractive index of water is very close to 1.33 in the relevant wavelength range, which for
ultrarelativistic particles with $\beta\approx 1$ gives a value of $\theta_{c}\approx 41^{\circ}$
- The threshold velocity for Cherenkov emmision is $\beta_{t}=1/n$

- Cherenkov emission per unit wavelength per centimetre travelled by the particle is\dots
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d^{2}N}{d\lambda dx}=\frac{2\pi\alpha^{2}}{\lambda^{2}}
    (1-\frac{1}{1-\beta^{2}n^{2}(\lambda)})
    \label{eq:cherenkov_emission}
\end{equation}

- By reconstructing the Cherenkov cone of light deposited in the detector PMTs info about the
interaction can be determined.
- Muons will be a single well-defined cone, electron will produce EM shower, results in all the
shower particle cherenkov ones overapping, so a distincttly `fuzzy cone' is produced.
- THis allows these two or events with multiple rings to be told apart.

\begin{figure} % EMISSION DISTANCE DIAGRAM %
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{diagrams/4-chips/emission_distance.pdf}
    \caption[Fraction of Cherenkov photons emitted as a function of distance.]
    {The fraction of the total number of photons emitted as a function of the distance from the
        interaction vertex for both electrons and muons. Note how the muon travels much further
        emitted an approximately constant amount of Cherenkov radiation as it does so.}
    \label{fig:emission distance}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure} % EMISSION PROFILE DIAGRAM %
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{diagrams/4-chips/emission_profile.pdf}
    \caption[Emission profiles for both electrons and muons]
    {Emission profiles for both electrons (left) and muons (right). They show the fraction of the
        total number of emitted photons as a function of both the distance travelled from the
        interaction vertex and the angle of emission for each photon.}
    \label{fig:emission_profile}
\end{figure}

- The interaction of primary concern are NC interactions that produce a pi-zero
- They decay to a pair of photons with a branching ratio of 98.82\% reference
- And these will then pair-produce forming e-plus, e-minus pairs, each producing an EM shower
leading to two electron like rings.
- For a boosted pi-zero the separation angle, $\theta_{ij}$ between the rings is given by
\begin{equation}
    (1-\cos\theta_{ij})=\frac{m_{\pi}^2}{2E_{i}E_{k}}
\end{equation}
Where $m_{\pi}$ is the invariant mass of the $\pi^{0}$ and $E_{i}$ and $E_{j}$ are the energies
of the two photons respectively.
Therefore for a pi-zero decaying to two 1000 MeV photons gives a separation angle of
$\approx 8^{\circ}$. This creates two overlapping rings of hits picked up by the detector pmts
which can prove difficult to separate.

- TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENT TYPE OF INTERACTIONS AT HOW THEY MANIFEST DUE TO CHERENKOV RADIATION!!!

- If one photon has a much lower energy than the other, or they are very closely overlapped,
they are commonly misidentified as a single electron.
- The shape of the ring can then be used for particle identification
- Muon rings tend to be sharper and exhibit a `plateau' shape as they emit a constant amount of
Cherenkov radiation from a single particle over a period of time.
- Electron rings are more diffuse due to their production being from a electromagnetic shower.

\section{The \chipsfive detector} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:chips_detector} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

- The chips-5 detector is the first of these units, at 25m in diameter and 12m tall.
- This leads to a fiducial volume of ~5kton
- Will be initially deployed into the Wentworth Pit 2W in northen minnesota, which is 7 mrad
off-axis of the \numi beam.
- Also deep enough to allow for ~50m of everburden of water to reduce the cosmic background.
- Not at the ideal location (baseline) to measure the mass hierarchy in the \numi beam.
- Can help to constrain delta-cp by measuring electron neutrino appearance.
- Physics capabilities have been studied using GLoBES, should ask Tom for a nice plot and brief
description of how it all works.
- Wentworth 2W is a disused surface iron pit (taconite ore) owned by Cliffs natural resources.
- Has advantages of having the infastrucutre in place for heavy industry, such as power and roads.
- The main Polymet mining building is less than a mile from the deployment site which was used as
a laboratory environment for building detector compoenents on site.
- located at a latitude of 47.58N and longitude of 92.13W. It is 7 mrad off the centralaxis of the
\numi beam at a baseline of 712 km
- Water is drained from the pit in the spring to ensure it does not overflow during the summer
rainy season.
- Therefore, fluctutationsof +-3m are expected over the course of a year.
- A lighttight liner a polymer membrance is used to seperate the clean detector water from the
external pit water and isolate the detector volume.
- This detector will act as a proff of concept that the R\&D has been a success and the provide
possible improvements for future iterations.
- CHIPS will not initially have a near detector, however the use of NOVA one is possible if
required, but not important for now.
- You would really need a water cherenkov near detector, so it as simiar as possible as the far
detector.
- This allows the same event reco and PID minimising systematic uncertainties in the predicted
background at the far detector.
- Is prefered as it has the same neutrino interaction traget (water) ensuring efficiencies are
similar in both detector.
- However, it should be noted that a water cherenkov detector has never been proven in high
intensity environmenets such as the \numi beam (WTF is t2k then)
