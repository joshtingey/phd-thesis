\chapter{The \chips R\&D Project} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{chap:chips}

In pursuit of answers to the open questions outlined in the previous chapter, neutrino experiments
are becoming increasingly, and possibly prohibitively, expensive and impractical. This is
particularly true of the next generation long baseline experiments (DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande),
with cost estimates reaching billions of dollars and construction times of more than half a
decade. It is also telling that only two future projects receive the vast majority of global
research effort, such is their complexity, cost, and lead time.

It is clear that for detectors to remain practical and affordable into the future, a novel
approach to neutrino detector design is required. This is particularly true is megaton scale
detectors are ever to become a reality. While instrumentation will continue to improve with time,
the statistics of low event counts will always limit neutrino experiments until vastly larger
detectors can be built. Therefore, R\&D efforts must focus on such detectors while attempting to
complement the current and upcoming generation of experiments.

The \chips R\&D project~\cite{adamson2013} aims to develop novel strategies and technologies for
very large yet `cheap as chips' water Cherenkov detectors. Primarily aimed for deployment in long
baseline accelerator scenarios, \chips aims to lower the construction cost per kt of fiducial mass
to between \$200k-\$300k. For comparison, the Super-Kamiokande detector cost approximately \$4
million/kt to build. As physics sensitivity depends on more than just fiducial volume, this
comparison is not entirely rigorous; however, it highlights the scale of cost savings possible.

The \chips concept is to construct cylindrical water Cherenkov detectors that can then be sunk to
the bottom of deep bodies of water on the Earth's surface, such as lakes, reservoirs and flooded
mine pits. The water above the detectors provides a modest overburden from cosmic rays, while the
surrounding water provides support for a lightweight detector structure. By removing the need for
underground excavation and expensive structural support, the cost of construction can be
dramatically reduced.

Additionally, the common practice of building bespoke components for the majority of the detector
is replaced with using modern commercially available components wherever possible. The number of
expensive components, such as photomultiplier tubes is also reduced by only considering
accelerator beam neutrino events, such that full detector instrumentation is not required.

Furthermore, \chips detectors are not only designed to be cheap but practical. Easy to build,
quick to deploy, and upgradable one operational, multiple detector modules can be flexibly
combined depending on available resources. Compared to DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande that require a
large upfront budget and years to construct, \chips detector modules can be flexibly deployed in
under a year.

\subsubsection*{R\&D effort} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The \chips project consists of multiple R\&D streams outlined below, each with the primary goal of
proving a key component of the \chips concept is viable.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Detector construction:} Detailed in Section.~\ref{sec:chips_detector} this
          stream aims to prove that construction and deployment of a \chips detector is possible.
          Two prototype detectors have so far been deployed. Firstly, the very small \chipsm
          detector~\cite{perch2015, pfutznerProto2017, pfutzner2017} deployed into a flooded mine
          pit in northern Minnesota in the summer of 2014. Additionally, the much larger 5kt,
          \chipsfive detector deployed into the same pit in the summer of 2019.

    \item \textbf{Water filtration:} This stream aims to prove that adequate water purity can be
          achieved using cheap, commercially available filtration. Extensive
          studies~\cite{amat2017, campbell2020} have proven that by filtering water directly from
          the flooded mine pit using cheap filtration an adequate attenuation length of greater
          than \unit{50}{\mathrm{m}} is possible. This is not discussed further in this work.

    \item \textbf{Detector sensitivity:} This stream aims to prove that \chips detectors can
          provide significant physics contributions alongside the current and next generation of
          experiments. Single detectors in the NuMI beam and multiple detectors in the future LBNF
          beam have been considered in multiple studies~\cite{pfutzner2017, adde2016, lang2015}.
          This is not discussed further in this work.

    \item \textbf{Data acquisition:} Outlined in Chapter.~\ref{chap:daq} this stream aims to prove
          that a cheap data acquisition system using commercially available components in
          viable~\cite{eijk2018}. \chips implements a novel use of cheap single-board computers to
          collect data from multiple PMTs.

    \item \textbf{Event reconstruction and identification:} Detailed in Chapter.~\ref{chap:cvn}
          this stream aims to prove that modern machine learning techniques can be applied to
          water Cherenkov detectors such as \chips. This work both feeds into the detector
          sensitivity work mentioned above and also allows to detector optimisation studies to be
          carried out.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

So far, \chips efforts have been based in the USA to exploit the NuMI beam before the end of its
lifetime. Future plans are focused on the scaling of \chips detectors and the deployment of
multiple modules in the LBNF beam once it becomes operational.

\subsection{The neutrino beam} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:chips_concept_beam} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

- CHIPS will use a neutrino beam to measure,
- These can be measured using four data sample, two for neutrino and two for antineutrinos.
- These sample are produced by "Forward Horn current" FHC and "Reverse Horn current" RHC,
producing predominetetly neutrinos and anti-neutrinos respectively.
- Neutrino oscillation probabilities can then be inferred by comparisons of the observed neutrino
spectra and the near and far detectors.
- Primarily muon neutrinos can be produced by using a particle accelerator to direct a proton beam
at a target. By focusing the pions and kaons this produces, a neutrino beam created from the
downstream decays, creates the muon neutrino beam.
- Better to think of \chips applying to any Beam
- Here we will talk about the NuMI beam as the prime example as that is the one used for the
current generation of \chips prototype.
- Possible future \chips in LBNF which is primarily being built for DUNE
- The \numi beam big paper~\cite{adamson2016}
- How will LBNF be different from NuMI, upgrades etc...

\end{figure}

\subsection{Water Cherenkov events} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:chips_concept_cherenkov} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

- Dissapearence channels sensitive to %abs(delta31^2), and sin^2(2theta23).
- Apperence channels sensitive to all four parameters including sign of %delta32^2.
- The "signal" in all cases are CC interactions, therefore selection of nuel, anuel, numu and
anumu CC is the goal.
- Main background in CC numu selections are NC with charged pions.
- Main background in CC nuel selections is pi-zero NC, which can mimic the chracteristic EM
shower, due to its near certain decay into two photons.
- You get a small number of nuel intrinsic to the beam, they are just a background as they are
indistinguishabe from the nuel appreaence neutrinos.
- Once you have collected samples in all four cases, a fit is performed to the reconstructed
neutrino energy distributions to extract the four neutrino oscillation parameters.

- CHERENKOV RADIATION -> PMTS -> TYPES OF EVENT (main problem ones etc...)

- Operate on the fact that charged particles travelling faster than the local speed of light in a
dielectric medium will emit photons due to the Cherenkov effect.
- Therefore water Cherenkov detectors consist of a large body of water instrumented with
photomultiplier tubes.
- A neutrino interacts with nucleon in thw water emitting a charged particle such as an electron or
muon.
- If particle is sufficiently relativistic it will emit Cherenkov radiation.
- The induced polarisation of the water molecules in the wake of the charged particle causes a
coherent shock wave of light to be emitted.
- Excite electron and atoms in its path which then must return to the ground state by emitting
radiation.
0 As the particle is faster than speed on light in medium the wavefront is in the shape of a cone
simlar to the wake behind a boat.

\begin{figure} % CHERENKOV EFFECT DIAGRAM DIAGRAM %
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{diagrams/4-chips/cherenkov.png}
    \caption[Diagram of Cherenkov radiation.]
    {Diagram of Cherenkov radiation emission and wavefront angles. The angles $\theta_{c}$ and
        $\eta$ are not equal in a dispersive medium. Figure taken from Ref.~\cite{particle2020}
    }
    \label{fig:cherenkov}
\end{figure}

- Charged particle emit Cherenkov radiation if their velocity is greater than the local phase
velocity of light in the medium through which they are travelling.
- The angle at which the Cherenkov radiation is emmited relative to the particles direction of
travel is given by Ref.~\cite{particle2020}
\begin{equation}
    cos\theta_{c} = \frac{1}{n\beta}
    \label{eq:cherenkov_angle}
\end{equation}
- Where n is the refractive index of the medium and $\beta=v/c$
- n is actually a function of the light wavelength $\lambda$
- The refractive index of water is very close to 1.33 in the relevant wavelength range, which for
ultrarelativistic particles with $\beta\approx 1$ gives a value of $\theta_{c}\approx 41^{\circ}$
- The threshold velocity for Cherenkov emmision is $\beta_{t}=1/n$

- Cherenkov emission per unit wavelength per centimetre travelled by the particle is\dots
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d^{2}N}{d\lambda dx}=\frac{2\pi\alpha^{2}}{\lambda^{2}}
    (1-\frac{1}{1-\beta^{2}n^{2}(\lambda)})
    \label{eq:cherenkov_emission}
\end{equation}

- By reconstructing the Cherenkov cone of light deposited in the detector PMTs info about the
interaction can be determined.
- Muons will be a single well-defined cone, electron will produce EM shower, results in all the
shower particle cherenkov ones overapping, so a distincttly `fuzzy cone' is produced.
- THis allows these two or events with multiple rings to be told apart.

\begin{figure} % EMISSION DISTANCE DIAGRAM %
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{diagrams/4-chips/emission_distance.pdf}
    \caption[Fraction of Cherenkov photons emitted as a function of distance.]
    {The fraction of the total number of photons emitted as a function of the distance from the
        interaction vertex for both electrons and muons. Note how the muon travels much further
        emitted an approximately constant amount of Cherenkov radiation as it does so.}
    \label{fig:emission distance}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure} % EMISSION PROFILE DIAGRAM %
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{diagrams/4-chips/emission_profile.pdf}
    \caption[Emission profiles for both electrons and muons]
    {Emission profiles for both electrons (left) and muons (right). They show the fraction of the
        total number of emitted photons as a function of both the distance travelled from the
        interaction vertex and the angle of emission for each photon.}
    \label{fig:emission_profile}
\end{figure}

- The interaction of primary concern are NC interactions that produce a pi-zero
- They decay to a pair of photons with a branching ratio of 98.82\% reference
- And these will then pair-produce forming e-plus, e-minus pairs, each producing an EM shower
leading to two electron like rings.
- For a boosted pi-zero the separation angle, $\theta_{ij}$ between the rings is given by
\begin{equation}
    (1-\cos\theta_{ij})=\frac{m_{\pi}^2}{2E_{i}E_{k}}
\end{equation}
Where $m_{\pi}$ is the invariant mass of the $\pi^{0}$ and $E_{i}$ and $E_{j}$ are the energies
of the two photons respectively.
Therefore for a pi-zero decaying to two 1000 MeV photons gives a separation angle of
$\approx 8^{\circ}$. This creates two overlapping rings of hits picked up by the detector pmts
which can prove difficult to separate.

- TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENT TYPE OF INTERACTIONS AT HOW THEY MANIFEST DUE TO CHERENKOV RADIATION!!!

- If one photon has a much lower energy than the other, or they are very closely overlapped,
they are commonly misidentified as a single electron.
- The shape of the ring can then be used for particle identification
- Muon rings tend to be sharper and exhibit a `plateau' shape as they emit a constant amount of
Cherenkov radiation from a single particle over a period of time.
- Electron rings are more diffuse due to their production being from a electromagnetic shower.

\section{The \chipsfive detector} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:chips_detector} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

- The chips-5 detector is the first of these units, at 25m in diameter and 12m tall.
- This leads to a fiducial volume of ~5kton
- Will be initially deployed into the Wentworth Pit 2W in northen minnesota, which is 7 mrad
off-axis of the \numi beam.
- Also deep enough to allow for ~50m of everburden of water to reduce the cosmic background.
- Not at the ideal location (baseline) to measure the mass hierarchy in the \numi beam.
- Can help to constrain delta-cp by measuring electron neutrino appearance.
- Physics capabilities have been studied using GLoBES, should ask Tom for a nice plot and brief
description of how it all works.
- Wentworth 2W is a disused surface iron pit (taconite ore) owned by Cliffs natural resources.
- Has advantages of having the infastrucutre in place for heavy industry, such as power and roads.
- The main Polymet mining building is less than a mile from the deployment site which was used as
a laboratory environment for building detector compoenents on site.
- located at a latitude of 47.58N and longitude of 92.13W. It is 7 mrad off the centralaxis of the
\numi beam at a baseline of 712 km
- Water is drained from the pit in the spring to ensure it does not overflow during the summer
rainy season.
- Therefore, fluctutationsof +-3m are expected over the course of a year.
- A lighttight liner a polymer membrance is used to seperate the clean detector water from the
external pit water and isolate the detector volume.
- This detector will act as a proff of concept that the R\&D has been a success and the provide
possible improvements for future iterations.
- CHIPS will not initially have a near detector, however the use of NOVA one is possible if
required, but not important for now.
- You would really need a water cherenkov near detector, so it as simiar as possible as the far
detector.
- This allows the same event reco and PID minimising systematic uncertainties in the predicted
background at the far detector.
- Is prefered as it has the same neutrino interaction traget (water) ensuring efficiencies are
similar in both detector.
- However, it should be noted that a water cherenkov detector has never been proven in high
intensity environmenets such as the \numi beam (WTF is t2k then)
