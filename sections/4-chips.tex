\sections{Things to talk about}

- General overview of why a large, cheap detector like CHIPS is needed
PLOT: 
- Brief overview of what CHIPS could add to physics, what it can detect etc...
- general non-detailed description of the general principles behind CHIPS

- First how beam water Cherenkov detect events
- Describe the Numi beam
- An aside on the off-axis effect
- Describe the Cherenkov effect
- Describe the flux and expected cross-sections / types of event
- Give the expected number of events that CHIPS should see
- An aside on GENIE which we used for event generation
- Describe all the possible interactions that can be observed in CHIPS
- What are the classic difficulties with water Cherenkov detectors
- Brief description of how PMTs detect the cherenkov light
