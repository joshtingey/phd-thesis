\section{Events for the CHIPS detector}
\label{sec:chips_events}
- First how beam water Cherenkov detect events
- Describe the Numi beam
- An aside on the off-axis effect
- Describe the Cherenkov effect
- Describe the flux and expected cross-sections / types of event
- Give the expected number of events that CHIPS should see
- An aside on GENIE which we used for event generation
- Describe all the possible interactions that can be observed in CHIPS
- What are the classic difficulties with water Cherenkov detectors
- Brief description of how PMTs detect the cherenkov light
- CHIPS detector simulation
- Example plots of events for different signature types of events...
- We always need to consider the two main signal channels muon dissapearance and electon appearance, and their main backgrounds
NC 1pi+- and 1pi0 respectively.

EQUATION: Off-axis effect equations
EQUATION: Cherenkov effect equation

- The CHIPS-M detector and conclusions
- The CHIPS-10 detector
- General structure, how it all holds together
- How it is deployed/extended
- How it detects the Cherenkov light with PMTs arranged in planes
- How the construction went
- Current status and future plans
- The tau neutrino component is negligible and not predicted by the simulation
