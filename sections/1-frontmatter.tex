\begin{abstract} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    The CHerenkov detectors In mine PitS (\chips) neutrino detector R\&D project aims to develop
    novel strategies and technologies for very large yet `cheap as chips' water Cherenkov neutrino
    detectors. Via deployment in a body of water, use of commercially available components, and
    instrumentation coverage optimisation for the study of only accelerator beam neutrinos, \chips
    will enable megaton scale detectors to become a reality at the cost of \$200k-\$300k per kt of
    sensitive mass. During the summer of 2019 a prototype \chips detector, \chipsfive, was
    deployed into the Wentworth 2W disused mine pit in northern Minnesota, \SI{7}{\text{mrad}} off
    the \numi beam axis. A novel data acquisition system was introduced using cheap single-board
    computers and open-source software.

    This work presents a novel approach to water Cherenkov neutrino detector event reconstruction
    and classification. Three forms of a Convolutional Neural Network, a type of deep learning
    algorithm, have been trained to reject cosmic muon events, classify beam events, and estimate
    neutrino energies, all using only a slightly modified version of the raw detector event as
    input. When evaluated on the expected distribution of \chipsfive events, this new approach is
    shown to be robust and explainable as well as providing a significant performance increase
    over the standard likelihood-based reconstruction and simple neural network classification.
    Promisingly, the performance presented here is comparable to the more complex (and expensive)
    neutrino oscillation experiments within the field.

\begin{abstract}[Impact Statement] %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    The impact of this work inside the domain of academia is straightforward and explained in
    great detail throughout the thesis. A novel application of modern machine learning techniques
    is made to reconstruct and classify neutrino events within a water Cherenkov detector studying
    neutrino oscillations. Although other experiments within the field have conducted similar
    preliminary work, this is the first known comprehensive application of such methods.
    Hopefully, this work will promote the use of these techniques for water Cherenkov neutrino
    detectors more broadly.
    
    Outside of academia, the impact of this work is less clear. Still, it is probably most
    pronounced in the field of machine learning, which promises to bring substantial societal
    advancements. Sometimes the application of machine learning to real-world problems is seen as
    somewhat secondary to achieving marginally incremental improvements on standardised
    challenges. Hopefully, this work works as part of a broader effort to make the application of
    machine learning methods more important and broaden the scope of tasks considered. Currently,
    the field is dominated by the commercial needs of a small number of large technology
    companies, such as Google and Facebook, any work that applies machine learning to a novel task
    can only help to broaden the scope of machine learning and make it more applicable to a wider
    range of real-world tasks.

    Firstly I would like to thank my supervisor Jenny for the independence she offered me
    throughout by PhD to pursue the research path that interested me most, and furthermore, for
    leading the whole \chips collaboration through two intense summers of construction activity in
    Hoyt Lakes.

    I would also like to thank everyone within the broader \chips collaboration. Foremost Stefano
    for all of his incredible support and advice throughout all the stages of my PhD, as well as
    the UCL group of Tom, Sim, Petr, and John for always being around and making the gulag
    bearable. 

    I would also like to thank everyone else within the UCL HEP group, particularly my D14 office
    mates.

    Most importantly, I must thank Becca and my family for all of their endless support.

\begin{preface}
    Provide a preface at the beginning outlining what work you undertook in each chapter, to make
    it clear all the work you carried out as part of this thesis. Describe (list) all the things
    you actually did for CHIPS and how they relate to the chapters of this work.

    I carried out almost all stages of the research myself, due to the relatively small number of
    people on the project.

    CHIPS:

        Although the author's primary focus was on work for the final two efforts above, a
        contribution to non DAQ related \chipsfive construction efforts were also made. This work
        included helping with both the instrumentation testing and calibration as well as
        installation within \chipsfive. Furthermore, the author played a significant role in the
        development of the event generation and detector simulation framework presented in
        \SectionRef{sec:chips_monte_carlo}.

    DAQ: 
        - for which the author played a major role. 
    
        The author played a major role in both the development and construction of the DAQ system
        for \chipsfive. Specifically, a significant contribution to the development of the
        networking solution and high-level hardware implementation was made, alongside building
        the control and monitoring software. Furthermore, the author played a role in the
        development of the novel low-level Madison $\micro$DAQ and Beaglebone DAQ system.

    MACHINE LEARNING STUFF:
        - This work is solely that of the author's.
        - This is the main bulk of the authors work.
        - Full pipeline from event generation to simulation, training, everything, most of the
        software etc...
