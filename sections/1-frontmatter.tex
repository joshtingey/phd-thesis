\begin{abstract} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    - blah blah blah not more than 300 words
    - Brief explanation of CHIPS and what it is and its current status
    - This is the first full implementation of deep learning to Cherenkov detector.
    - Significant improvement in performance to make CHIPS comparable with much more expensive and
    complex experiments.
    - Hoped this work will also inform the work of others when implementing CNNs for similar water
    Cherenkov experiments.

\chapter*{\centering Impact Statement} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
- blah blah blah no more than 500 words
- Describe how the expertise, knowledge, analysis, discovery or insight in the thesis could be put
to beneficial use. Consider benefits inside and outside of academia and the ways in which these
benefits can be brought about.
- Outside academia could be commercial, social enterprise, professional practice, public service,
laws, public discourse, culture, quality of life and environment.
- Inside academia, future scholarship, research methods or methodology, the curriculum.

- Any work that forwards and encourages these methods to be applied more broadly can only have a
positive impact of both the field it belongs to, the wider physics community and the field of
machine learning research at large. 

- Advances in machine learning have principally been driven by the commercial needs of large
technology companies such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft. They obviously have a
narrower vision of goals than the broad spectrum of research currently underway across the world.
- By applying and encouraging the use of machine leaning in research fields, advances in machine
learning, possibly with commerical impact could be discovered, that would not have been found
without searching in some specific physics research channel for example.
