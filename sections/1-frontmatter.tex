\begin{abstract} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    The CHerenkov detectors In mine PitS (\chips) neutrino detector R\&D project aims to - blah
    blah blah not more than 300 words - Brief explanation of CHIPS and what it is and its current
    status - This is the first full implementation of deep learning to Cherenkov detector. -
    Significant improvement in performance to make CHIPS comparable with much more expensive and
    complex experiments. - Hoped this work will also inform the work of others when implementing
    CNNs for similar water Cherenkov experiments.

\begin{abstract}[Impact Statement] %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    The impact of this work inside the domain of academia is straightforward and explained in
    great detail throughout the thesis. A novel application of modern machine learning techniques
    is made to the reconstruction and classification of neutrino events within a water Cherenkov
    detector studying neutrino oscillations. Although some similar preliminary work has been done
    by other experiments within the field, this is the first known comprehensive application of
    such methods. Hopefully, this work will promote the use of similar techniques for water
    Cherenkov neutrino detectors more broadly.
    
    Outside of academia, the impact of this work is less clear. Still, it is probably most
    pronounced in the field of machine learning which promises to bring huge societal
    advancements. Sometimes the application of machine learning to real-world problems is seen as
    somewhat secondary to achieving marginally incremental improvements on standardised
    challenges. This work hopefully works as part of a broader effort to not only make the
    application of machine learning methods more important, but also to broaden the scope of tasks
    considered. Currently, the field is dominated by the commercial needs of a small number of
    large technology companies, such as Google and Facebook, any work that applies machine
    learning to a novel task can only help to broaden the research of machine learning and make it
    more applicable to real-world tasks.

    Firstly I would like to thank my supervisor Jenny, for the independence she has given my
    throughout my PhD and for leading the whole \chips collaboration through two intense summers
    of construction activity. 
    
    I would like to thank everyone within the broader \chips collaboration. Foremost Stefano for
    all of his incredible support and advice throughout all the stages of my PhD, as well as the
    UCL gang of Tom, Sim, Petr, and John for always being around and making the gulag bearable.
    
    I would also like to thank everyone else within the UCL HEP group, particularly those within
    the D14 office. Finally, but definitely not least, I must thank my Angel Queen (Becca) and my
    family for all of their support.
