\begin{abstract} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    The CHerenkov detectors In mine PitS (\chips) neutrino detector R\&D project aims to develop
    novel strategies and technologies for very large yet `cheap as chips' water Cherenkov neutrino
    detectors. Via deployment in a body of water, use of commercially available components, and
    instrumentation coverage optimisation for the study of only accelerator beam neutrinos, \chips
    will enable megaton scale detectors to become a reality at the cost of \$200k-\$300k per kt of
    sensitive mass. During the summer of 2019 a \unit{5}{\text{kt}} prototype \chips detector,
    \chipsfive, was deployed into the Wentworth 2W disused mine pit in northern Minnesota,
    \unit{7}{\text{mrad}} off the \numi beam axis. A novel data acquisition system was introduced
    using cheap single-board computers and open-source software.

    This work presents a novel approach to water Cherenkov neutrino detector event reconstruction
    and classification. Three forms of a Convolutional Neural Network, a type of deep learning
    algorithm, have been trained to reject cosmic muon events, classify beam events, and estimate
    neutrino energies, all using only a slightly modified version of the raw detector event as
    input. When evaluated on the expected distribution of \chipsfive events, this new approach is
    shown to be robust and explainable as well as providing a significant performance increase
    over the standard likelihood-based reconstruction and simple neural network classification.
    Promisingly, the performance presented here is comparable to the more complex (and expensive)
    neutrino oscillation experiments within the field.

\begin{abstract}[Impact Statement] %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    The impact of this work inside the domain of academia is straightforward and explained in
    great detail throughout the thesis. A novel application of modern machine learning techniques
    is made to the reconstruction and classification of neutrino events within a water Cherenkov
    detector studying neutrino oscillations. Although other experiments within the field have
    conducted similar preliminary work, this is the first known comprehensive application of such
    methods. Hopefully, this work will promote the use of these techniques for water Cherenkov
    neutrino detectors more broadly.

    Outside of academia, the impact of this work is less clear. Still, it is probably most
    pronounced in the field of machine learning, which promises to bring substantial societal
    advancements. Sometimes the application of machine learning to real-world problems is seen as
    somewhat secondary to achieving marginally incremental improvements on standardised
    challenges. This work hopefully works as part of a broader effort to not only make the
    application of machine learning methods more important but also to broaden the scope of tasks
    considered. Currently, the field is dominated by the commercial needs of a small number of
    large technology companies, such as Google and Facebook, any work that applies machine
    learning to a novel task can only help to broaden the scope of machine learning and make it
    more applicable to a wider range of real-world tasks.
