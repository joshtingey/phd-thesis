\begin{comment}
Welcome to neutrino physics, it all began at the beggining of the century with Wolfgang puali etc
etc... Lots of postulating from various people and some really cool experiments with lots of
exciting details later, it was found that there was a neutrino corresponding to each of the
leptons, electon, muon and tau. In the original standard model these are expected to be massless,
charge-0, spin 1/2 particles that are very very waekly interacting with tiny cross sections,
making them an increadibly difficult challenge for experimentalists in the years to come.

It was then noticed by a succesion of different experiments that a few different things did not
add up, the number of neutrinos seen with the expected flavour was wrong. Lots of people then
invested loads of time into tyring to figure this out and it was finally found by SNO which used
channels sensative to the three flavours in different ways, that some neutrinos had turned into
other neutrino flavours, shock horror.

This is explained by supposing that the neutrino flavour states (the ones that interact with the
weak force) are infact a superposition of neutrino mass states. The mixing between these two basis
is described by the PMNS matrix, which contains 3 mixing angles and a phase. An additional two
phases are included if the particles are majorana. What this means is that as the energy states
porpogate through matter differently, he superposition of them leads to neutrino oscillations as
the probability of detecting a certain flavour state changes as the neutrino travels.

The actual oscillation probability derivation is quite complex, and is affected by the matter
through which it travels due to matter having lots of electrons in it. But it generally leads to
sinosoidal probabilities with a phase dependent on the neutrino mass splitting and L/E and an
amplitude dependent on the mixing angles. The single phase, also governs if this oscillation
probability is different between neutrinos and anti-neutrinos and it hence known as the CP
violating phase.

So far we have been able to measure all the phases but we still don't know what delta-cp is, the
octant of theta23 or the mass hierarchy which is the ordering of the masses of the nuutrinos as we
only really measure the mass-spllittings. Splitting the PMNS matrix into the three common areas,
atmospheric, solar and reactor and investigating these three classic experimantal measuring
regions allows us to make conclusions about different parameters and gives us sensitivity to
different neutrino oscillation paramters.

Current experiments such as Nova and T2K are looking at delta-cp and the hierarchy, but it is
likely that we will need ther VERY VERY expensive DUNE experiment to finally figure things out. As
neutrinos very rarely interact it is always a size game with experiments, as all you really are
playing is a counting game. The larger the detection volume, the more nuutrinos you can detect and
as long as you energy resolution is good enough to resolve the oscillations in you particular L/E
regime you have a better experiment than everyone else. VOLUME VOLUME VOLUME, CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP!!!

\section{A history}
\label{sec:theory_history}

\subsection{Discovery of the neutrinos} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:theory_history_neutrinos}

In the early 20th century, beta decays were assumed to follow the simple two-body process, $A
    \rightarrow B + e$, where nuclei spontaneously emit a single electron. To conserve both energy
and angular momentum, the ejected electron was thought to have discrete kinetic energy,
defined by the difference in binding energies between the initial and final nuclei states.
However, in 1914, J. Chadwick instead measured a continuous electron energy
spectrum~\cite{chadwick1914}, placing this theory in doubt.

W. Pauli proposed a `desperate solution' to this paradox in 1930~\cite{pauli1930}. If a light,
neutrally charged, spin $1/2$ particle was also produced, the continuous energy distribution could
be explained. Initially, this mysterious new particle was named the `neutron'. However, to avoid
confusion with the heavy baryon of the same name discovered in 1932, E. Fermi renamed it the
`neutrino' when he formalised beta decay in 1934~\cite{fermi1934}.

The following month, H. Bethe and R. Peierls~\cite{bethe1934} used Fermi's work to estimate the
cross-section of the inverse beta decay process:
\begin{equation} % INVERSE BETA DECAY EQUATION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \bar{\nu} + p^{+} \rightarrow n + e^{+}.
    \label{eq:inverse_beta_decay}
\end{equation} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
An upper limit of $10^{-44} \mathrm{cm}^2$ was calculated, an incredibly small value, leading them to
declare `there is no practically possible way of observing the neutrino.' This statement hinted at
the vast difficulties experimentalists would face hunting down and measuring the neutrino in the
years to come.

After an initial tentative identification if 1953, F. Reines and C. Cowan made the first confirmed
observation of the neutrino in 1956~\cite{cowan1956}. Electron antineutrinos produced within the
Savannah River Plant nuclear reactor were detected via the inverse beta decay process outlined in
Eq.~\ref{eq:inverse_beta_decay}. In an underground room of the reactor building, A
`club-sandwich' detector of three 1500 litre liquid scintillator tanks and two 200 litre cadmium
doped water target tanks, was constructed. A total of 330 photomultiplier tubes then measured the
two successive characteristic signals for the interaction, allowing for the rejection of the
sizeable cosmic ray background. Firstly, a prompt positron annihilation, followed shortly
afterwards by a gamma-ray burst from the neutron capture.

A second distinct neutrino, the muon neutrino was discovered in 1962 at the Alternating Gradient
Synchrotron (AGS) at Brookhaven~\cite{danby1962}. Protons from the AGS beam incident upon a fixed
target produced charged pions. These would then decay into a beam of muons and neutrinos. After
passing through steel and lead absorbers to remove the muons, neutrino interactions were detected
in a series of spark chambers. If only a single neutrino existed, both interactions
\begin{equation} % BROOKHAVEN DECAY EQUATIONS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \nu+p^{+}\rightarrow\mu^{+}+n \\
    \nu+p^{+}\rightarrow e^{+}+n
\end{equation} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
would be expected to occur at the same rate. However, only muons, identified by a single long
track were detected, confirming the existence of the muon neutrino. Not only was this experiment
the first to construct and use an artificial neutrino beam, but it also won the 1988 Nobel prize.

The $Z^{0}$ and $W^{\pm}$ bosons, the force carriers of the weak force, through which neutrinos
interact, were discovered at the Super Proton Synchrotron at CERN in
1983~\cite{arnison1983_z,arnison1983_w}. Crucially, as $Z^{0}$ bosons were expected to decay to
neutrinos, measurements made to the decay width could strongly constrain the number of neutrino
flavours. The ALEPH experiment among others at the LEP $e^{+}e^{-}$ collider in the 1990s made
such precise measurements, indicating that the number of light active neutrino flavours to be
$2.984\pm0.008$~\cite{electroweak2006}, see Fig.~\ref{fig:z_resonance}.

        experiments at LEP. The curves show the predicted cross-section for two, three, and four
        neutrinos. Note how the data fits the three neutrino hypothesis increadibly well.

\end{figure} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Combined with the discovery of the charged tau lepton in 1975~\cite{perl1975}, this suggested that
there was a third tau neutrino. The DONUT experiment at Fermilab finally discovered this particle
in 2001~\cite{Kodama2001} using 800 \GeV ~protons from the Tevatron, completing the trio of
neutrinos we know of today. Any additional neutrinos must either be sterile (do not couple to the
weak force) or have a mass greater than $0.5m_{Z}$.

\subsection{Discovery of neutrino oscillations} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:theory_history_neutrinos}

At the Homestake mine\footnote{The Homestake mine will be used for the future DUNE experiment
    discussed later} in the 1960s, a large tank, placed 1.5 km underground, was filled with
400000 litres of the dry cleaning fluid, perchloroethylene ($C_{4}Cl_{8}$). Its goal was to
measure the solar electron neutrino flux incident upon the earth via the interaction:
\begin{equation} % HOMESTAKE CHLORINE EQUATION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    {}^{37}Cl+\nu_{e}\rightarrow{}^{37}Ar+e^{-},
\end{equation} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
allowing the neutrino flux to convert the chlorine contained within the tank to the noble gas
argon. Every few weeks the tank was purged with gaseous helium and the amount of argon generated,
and indirectly the neutrino flux measured.

After analysis, the number of electron neutrino interactions per ${}^{37}Cl$, per second was found
to be no higher than 3~\cite{davis1968}. When compared to the predictions made by the Standard
Solar Model which ranged between 4.4 and 22~\cite{bahcall1968}, this indicated a deficit. Dubbed
the `solar neutrino problem', it was initially believed to be due to an unexplained experimental
flaw. However, other experiments, such as the water Cherenkov Kamiokande II~\cite{hirata1989} and
both the SAGE and GALLEX galium based capture tanks also observed this
discrepancy~\cite{abazov1991,anselmann1994}.

A neutrino deficit was also observed indirectly in the atmospheric sector. Neutrinos generated in
the atmosphere by cosmic rays formed a key background to the Kamiokande and IMD experiments, both
designed to measure proton decay. When evaluating this background, they observed a deficit in the
number of muon neutrinos compared to electron neutrinos~\cite{hirata1988, becker1992}. The
successor to the Kamiokande experiment Super-Kamiokande also measured the same
deficit~\cite{kajita1999}.

The phenomenon of neutrino oscillations, discussed in detail later in this chapter, was put
forward as a solution to this problem. If neutrinos could change flavour as they propagated, the
measured deficits could be explained. The SNO experiment finally confirmed this in
2001~\cite{ahmad2002}.

The SNO experiment consisted of a 1 kton tank of deuterium (heavy water), equiped with 9500
photomultiplier tubes. Light from three seperate neutrino interactions channels:
\begin{align} % SNO INTERACTIONS EQUATIONS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \nu_{i}+e^{-} & \rightarrow \nu_{i}+e^{-} \\
    \nu_{i}+d     & \rightarrow p+n+\nu_{i}   \\
    \nu_{e}+d     & \rightarrow p+p+e^{-}
\end{align} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
was measured, where $d$ is the deuterium nucleus. The first and second channels were sensitive to
all three neutrino flavours, but importantly only electron neutrinos could interact via the third
channel. By comparing the rates between the channels, SNO was able to prove to 5.3$\sigma$ that
electron neutrinos had oscillated to other flavours, while the total solar neutrino flux remained
constant.

\section{The Standard Model and neutrinos}
\label{sec:theory_sm}

The Standard Model of particle physics describes the 17 known fundamental subatomic particles and
the interactions that take place between them. Combining both quantum chromodynamics (describing
the strong force) and electroweak theory (describing the electomagnetic and weak forces), it is a
gauge theory obeying the local gauge symmetries of $U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3)$. The particles,
along with their various properties are outlined in Fig.~\ref{fig:sm}, additionally, all have an
associated anti-particle with the exact same quantum numbers except opposite electric charge.

\begin{figure} % STANDARD MODEL DIAGRAM %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \includegraphics[origin=c,width=0.6\textwidth]{diagrams/3-theory/sm.png}
    \caption[The Standard Model particles]
    {The Standard Model particles. Figure taken from Ref.~\cite{wiki2020}.}
    \label{fig:sm}
\end{figure} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The six quarks and six leptons, all spin 1/2 particles, are named fermions. Further divided into
three generations (or flavours), they make up all the matter content of the universe. The quarks
never exist in a free state and bind together into mesons, such as the pion, or baryons, such as
the proton. Three charged massive particles, the electron, muon and tau and their three
corresponding (assumed to be) massless neutrinos, make up the leptons.

The electromagnetic, strong and weak forces are carried by the spin 1 gauge bosons. The photon
carries the electromagnetic force (affecting all charged particles), the gluons carry the strong
force (which binds the quarks together) and the massive $Z^{0}$ and $W^{\pm}$ carry the weak
force. The final particle the Higgs, is a massive scalar boson. Via the process of sponteneous
symmetry breaking it provides the mechanism to give all the particles their mass.

Within the Standard Model neutrinos only interact via the weak force, exclusively coupling to the
$Z^{0}$ and $W^{\pm}$ bosons. As the weak interaction maximally violates parity, in that it only
couples to left-handed chiral particles, the original Standard Model only contains left-handed
neutrinos and their corresponding right-handed anti-neutrinos.

Although neutrinos where originally thought to be massless, and no direct detection of their mass
has been made, it is now believed that neutrinos are massive (albeit very light) particles. This
is due to the substantual amount of evidence in support of neutrino oscillations, which require
three distinct neutrino mass states, implying atleast two are non-zero.

Cosmological observations of the cosmic microwave background currently provide the best limit on
the combined sum of the neutrino masses at $\sum m_{\nu} < 0.12~\eV$~\cite{planck2018}, however,
this is strongly model dependent. The KATRIN experiment has been able to make model independent
direct measurements of the upper limit by looking at the energy spectrum of electrons emmited
from beta decay, giving a result of $m_{\nu} < 1.1~\eV$~\cite{aker2019}.

The Standard Model does not strictly rule out neutrino masses, and they can be generated by one
of two methods. Either, by including right-handed neutrino fields a Dirac mass term can be added
to the Standard Model lagrangian to introduce the neutrino masses via the usual Higgs mechanism.
Alternatively, if neutrinos are their own anti-particles, a Majorana mass term can be introduced,
however, this is lepton number violating.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Neutrino oscillations}
\label{sec:theory_oscillations}

The theory of neutrino oscillations was developed by B. Pontecorvo, Z. Maki, M. Nakagawa, and
S. Sakata in the 1960s~\cite{maki1962, pontecorvo1967, pontecorvo1969}. Fundamentally, it is a
manifestation of the phenomenom of quantum interference. If neutrinos are massive, their mass
eigenstates are not neccesarily the same as their weakly interacting flavour eigenstates. Instead,
the flavour states are a superposition of the three seperate mass states, which each propogate as
distinct waves evolving differently with time.

As a direct consequence of this, if a neutrino is created with a specific flavour $\alpha$, its
flavour composition will change with time, such that it may later be detected as having a flavour
$\beta$. The probability of this change is found to be periodic (hence oscillations), and depend
on the neutrino energy, the propogation distance and a rotational mixing matrix.

\subsection{Neutrino mixing}

The mixing between the flavour eigenstates $\ket{\nu_{\alpha}}$, where $\alpha=e,\mu,\tau$ and the
mass eigenstates $\ket{\nu_{k}}$, $k=1,2,3$, is described by the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakara
(PMNS) matrix $U$, such that,
\begin{equation} % FLAVOUR AS MASS EQUATION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \ket{\nu_{\alpha}}=\sum_{k}^{3}U_{\alpha k}^{*}\ket{\nu_{k}},
\end{equation} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
and vice-versa,
\begin{equation} % MASS AS FLAVOUR EQUATION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \ket{\nu_{k}}=\sum_{\alpha}^{3}U_{\alpha k}\ket{\nu_{\alpha}}.
\end{equation} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The PMNS matrix is a unitary, complex, $3\times3$ matrix, similar to the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa
(CKM) matrix for quark mixing, and has the form:
\begin{gather} % PMNS MATRIX SIMPLE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \ket{\nu_{e}}   \\
        \ket{\nu_{\mu}} \\
        \ket{\nu_{\tau}}
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        U_{e1}     & U_{e2}     & U_{e3}     \\
        U_{\mu 1}  & U_{\mu 2}  & U_{\mu 3}  \\
        U_{\tau 1} & U_{\tau 2} & U_{\tau 3}
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \ket{\nu_{1}} \\
        \ket{\nu_{2}} \\
        \ket{\nu_{3}}
    \end{pmatrix}.
\end{gather} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
A $3\times3$ matrix such as this can generally be described by three mixing angles and six complex
phases, however, the majority of these phases can be removed without affecting any physical
processes. This leaves three mixing angles $\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{23}$, $\theta_{13}$ and a
single phase $\delta$ which if non-zero produces CP violation and so is commonly named
$\delta_{CP}$.

With $s_{ij}=\sin \theta_{ij}$ and $c_{ij}=\cos \theta_{ij}$ the standard parameterisation of
$U$, assuming neutrinos are Dirac particles is given by,
\begin{align} % DIRAC PMNS MATRIX FULL %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \mathrm{U} & =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 0       & 0      \\
        0 & c_{23}  & s_{23} \\
        0 & -s_{23} & c_{23}
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        c_{13}                   & 0 & s_{13}e^{-i\delta_{CP}} \\
        0                        & 1 & 0                       \\
        -s_{13}e^{-i\delta_{CP}} & 0 & c_{13}
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        c_{12}  & s_{12} & 0 \\
        -s_{12} & c_{12} & 0 \\
        0       & 0      & 1
    \end{pmatrix}
    \\
               & =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        c_{12}c_{13}
         & s_{12}c_{13}
         & s_{13}e^{-i\delta_{CP}}                          \\
        -s_{12}c_{23}-c_{12}s_{23}s_{13}e^{i\delta_{CP}}
         & c_{12}c_{23}-s_{12}s_{23}s_{13}e^{i\delta_{CP}}
         & s_{23}c_{13}                                     \\
        s_{12}s_{23}-c_{12}c_{23}s_{13}e^{i\delta_{CP}}
         & -c_{12}s_{23}-s_{12}c_{23}s_{13}e^{i\delta_{CP}}
         & c_{23}c_{13}
    \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The three component representation seperates the regimes that are commonly explored by different
types of experiment, which will be desscribed in detail in the following chapter. If neutrinos are
instead Majorana in nature two additional phases $\alpha_{21}$ and $\alpha_{31}$ are required,
such that the mixing matrix needs to be multiplied by,
\begin{align} % MAJORANA DIAGONAL PMNS EQUATION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \mathrm{diag}(1, e^{\frac{i\alpha_{21}}{2}}, e^{\frac{i\alpha_{31}}{2}}).
\end{align} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Note that both these phases lie on the diagonal and hence have no effect on neutrino oscillations.

\subsection{Oscillations in vacuum}

As the neutrino mass states are eigenstates of the hamiltonian with energy eigenvalues $E_{k}$:
\begin{equation} % HAMILTONIAN EQUATION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    H \ket{\nu_{k}} = E_{k} \ket{\nu_{k}},
    \label{eq:hamiltonian}
\end{equation} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
their time evolution is described by the Schr$\mathrm{\ddot{o}}$dinger equation. This can be used
to determine how the neutrino flavour state, evolves with time, such that,
\begin{equation} % TIME EVOLUTION EQUATION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \ket{\nu_{\alpha}(t)}=\sum_{k}^{3}U_{\alpha k}^{*}e^{-iE_{k}t}\ket{\nu_{k}}.
    \label{eq:time_evolution_1}
\end{equation} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

After a time $t$, the probability of finding $\ket{\nu_{\alpha}}$ in the state $\ket{\nu_{\beta}}$
is then given by,
\begin{equation} % TIME EVOLUTION EQUATION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    P(\nu_{\alpha} \rightarrow \nu_{\beta}, t) = |\braket{\nu_{\beta}|\nu_{\alpha}(t)}|^{2}=
    \abs*{\sum_{k}^{3}U_{\alpha k}^{*}U_{\beta k}e^{-iE_{k}t}}^{2} \\
    =\sum_{k}^{3}\sum_{j}^{3}U_{\alpha k}^{*}U_{\beta k}U_{\alpha j}U_{\beta j}^{*}
    e^{i(E_{k}-E_{j})t}.
    \label{eq:osc_prob_1}
\end{equation} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
As neutrinos are ultrarelativistic ($p\simeq E$) the approximation,
\begin{equation} % ENERGY, MASS, MOMENTUM EQUATION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    E_{k}=\sqrt{\vec{p}_{k}^{\,2}+m_{k}^{2}}\simeq E+\frac{m_{k}^{2}}{2E},
    \label{eq:energy_mass_momentum}
\end{equation} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
where $\vec{p}_{k}$ and $m_{k}$ are the neutrino momentum and energy, and $E$ is the neutrino
energy without the mass, can be made. This allows the substitution,
\begin{equation} % ENERGY, MASS, MOMENTUM EQUATION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    E_{k}-E_{j}\approx\frac{\Delta m_{kj}^{2}}{2E},
    \label{eq:energy_mass_momentum}
\end{equation} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
where $\Delta m_{kj}^{2}$ is the squared mass difference (mass splitting) between the $k$ and $j$
mass states. Additionally the relativistic limit allows the simplification $t = L$, where
$L$ is the distance from neutrino creation to detection. Combined, the oscillation probability
can be written as,
\begin{align} % TIME EVOLUTION EQUATION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    P(\nu_{\alpha} \rightarrow \nu_{\beta}, t) = \delta_{\alpha\beta} & - 4\sum_{k>j}re(
    U_{\alpha k}^{*}U_{\beta k}U_{\alpha j}U_{\beta j}^{*})\sin^{2}\left(\frac{\Delta
        m_{kj}^{2}L}{4E}\right) \nonumber
    \\  & \pm 2\sum_{k>j}im(
    U_{\alpha k}^{*}U_{\beta k}U_{\alpha j}U_{\beta j}^{*})\sin\left(\frac{\Delta
        m_{kj}^{2}L}{4E}\right),
    \label{eq:osc_prob_2}
\end{align} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
where the last term has a positive sign for neutrinos and a negative sign for anti-neutrinos.

From inspecting Eq.~\ref{eq:osc_prob_2} the superpostion of mass eigenstates clearly drives the
oscillation of the flavour state. A set experimental location and neutrino source defines a
constant $L/E$. Therefore, the period of the oscillations is determined by the squared mass
difference between the flavour states $\Delta m_{kj}^{2}$, while the amplitude of the
oscillation arises from the elements of the PMNS matrix.

\subsection{Oscillations in matter}

- NEED TO INTRODUCE THE TWO FLAVOUR APPROXIMATION!!! What most experiments have used and can use

- Will discuss in detail CC and NC interactions in the following chapter. Just mention for now.
- Interaction with matter although weak has a measurable effect on the oscillation probabiities.
- Must be taken into account when neutrinos travel through a dense medium such as the earth.
- Coherent forward scattering of neutrinos with matter add interaction potention terms to the
neutrino energy, seperated into a CC and an NC term
- When the active neutrinos propogate through matter they experience an effective potential
due to their interactions.
- For three-flavour oscillations, this potential is only relavent from electron neutrinos and
anti-neutrinos. Due to the difference in their CC interactions with matter compared to the others.
- Need to modify the vacuum hamiltonian with an effective potential.
- Possible for a resonance to occur that can result in total transition from one flavour to another
if the resonance region is large enough.
- This effect is known as the Mikheev, Smirnov and Wolfenstein (MSW) effect.
- Affects solar neutrinos as well, which can experience these resonant transitions in the sun.
- Neutrinos in matter can coherently scatter upon components of atoms throuhg Z or W exchange.
- Coherent scatterings do do change the state of the system, preserving mom and e or particles
involved.
- When analysed quantitativeyl this imparts particles with an effective mass.
- The same for all three in the NC case, with Z exchange. But as terrstrial or solar matter
contains plentiful electrons but not muons or taus, the CC interaction only occurs for electrons.

with $n_{e}$ being the electron number density in the medium and $G_{F}$ is Fermi's constant.
-It modifies ther probability given in \ref{eq:osc_prob_2} changing the sine term.
- Due to the additinal potential this leads to a change in phase between the mass eigenstates.
- All can scatter coherently on nucleons via NC, where no charged leptons are created and the
exiting neutrinos has the same state as the entering one.
- Electron nu can scatter coherently on electrons by CC interactions, via the exchange of a W.
DIAGRAM: Maybe put the electron CC scattering diagram here.

Mikheyev oscillations in matter paper Ref.~\cite{mikheev1986}
Numu to nuel oscilaltion probability equation Ref.~\cite{cervera2000}

A full treatment of the oscillation probability including the matter effect gives the
oscilaltion shown in blah blah for the CHIPS detector when considering it beam neutrino source.
